Glucosylceramide accumulation in monocyte-macrophage cells leads to hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone lesions, and in severe cases, central nervous system (CNS) involvement [1]. Patients without CNS involvement are classified as type 1, while those with CNS involvement are classified as type 2 or type 3. N370S is the most common GC mutation associated with type 1 GD while L444P is the most prevalent GC mutation resulting in CNS involvement. Currently, there is no effective treatment for neuropathic GD._||_Pharmacological chaperoning is an emerging therapeutic strategy that uses ER permeable small molecules to bind and stabilize the folded state of GC in the ER, enabling its trafficking to the Golgi and onward to the lysosome [2,3]. However, pharmacological chaperones have not demonstrated activity toward the clinically most important L444P GC mutation in neuropathic Gaucher patient-derived fibroblasts. Therefore, novel small molecules to increase cellular L444P GC activity are desired._||_References:_||_1. Beutler E, Grabowski GA (2001) Gaucher disease.

Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism._||_NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the NPY-Y2 receptor, a 381-amino acid Galphai protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which decreases cytosolic cAMP production. NPY Y2 is expressed in the periventricular nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, tractus solitarius, septum and paraventricular nucleus brain regions (1,2). Due to its expression profile and biological action, NPY Y2 is an attractive target for anxiolytic research. Additionally, Y2 is predicted to be a therapeutic target in alcoholism. Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission, Y2 antagonists may also mediate anxiolytic-like effects in animal models (3). Consistent with this hypothesis Y2 receptor mutant mice demonstrate reduced anxiety behavior compared with wild type controls (4). Moreover, use of the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 has been_||_shown to suppress ethanol self-administration in rats (5). It has been reported, however, that the complex structure and high molecular weight of BIIE0246 limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool (6). Therefore, it is necessary to produce high affinity selective ligands for the Y2 receptor._||_References:_||_1.Wahlestedt C, Ekman R, Widerlov E.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling has been strongly implicated. TLR recognition of microbial components and partner proteins signaling are important elements of the innate immune response (1). TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins consisting of an extracellular domain and an IL1R homologous intracellular domain and are comprised of at least 9 members.  One of the TLRs, TLR4, recognizes lipopolysaccharides and signals through the shared adapter protein, MyD88 leading to activation of the NFKB pathway (2).  TLR4 signals enhance the immune response to bacterial infections but excessive signaling leads to severe inflammation and septic shock.  Probe compound inhibitors of TLR4-MyD88 will be useful in exploring the biology of TLR signaling, the NFKB pathway and innate immune responses.

STAT1 is largely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved in IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus STAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).

STATs are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are phosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear translocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although structurally similar, members of the STAT family (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess diverse biological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and anti-proliferative, while STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is largely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved in IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus STAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Currently available STAT1 modulators mediate modest effects on STAT-induced transcription, act indirectly by targeting JAK or other kinases activities, or are associated with adverse hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects (6, 7).  The liabilities of the current state of the art for STAT1 modulators necessitate the discovery of higher affinity probes.  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes associated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective potentiators of STAT1 activity may lead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases._||_ _||_References:_||_1.

Under circumstances of transient cell stress, the heat shock response and activities of molecular chaperones can restore protein homeostasis. In human disease, however, misfolded proteins can accumulate when polyglutamine-expansion proteins are chronically expressed over the life of the cell. Elevated expression of molecular chaperones suppresses protein misfolding/aggregation and toxicity phenotypes in various model systems of Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the respective proteins huntingtin, tau, alpha-synuclein, and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), associated with these diseases, result in the appearance of misfolded species that adopt alternate conformations. These observations led to the proposal that a common feature of diverse diseases of protein conformation is the appearance of alternate folded states that self-associate and form toxic species and protein aggregates.  _||_A role for Hsp70 family proteins in controlling these events has been widely studied. Studies with mammalian tissue culture cells, transgenic mice, Drosophila, and C. elegans have established that the heat shock response can be activated in cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins, suggesting a role for molecular chaperones as an adaptive survival response (3, 4).  Moreover, a direct relationship with polyglutamine diseases is suggested by the co-localization of several heat shock proteins, including Hdj-1, Hdj-2, Hsp70 and ubiquitin with polyglutamine aggregates in the tissues of affected individuals, transgenic mice and tissue culture cells (5).  Finally, overexpression of Hsp70 can suppress the toxicity associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins (6-8).  High throughput screening initiatives aimed at the identification of compounds that enhance the heat shock response, in particular Hsp70, will provide insights into this conserved cellular process and may lead to novel therapeutics for these devastating disorders._||_References:_||_1.

The nuclear tyrosine kinase Wee1 mediates inhibitory phosphorylation of Tyr15 on cdc2, leading to delayed mitosis and cell cycle arrest in cells with DNA damage so that DNA repair and replication can occur (1, 2). During mitosis Wee1 activity is inhibited by its phosphorylation (3, 4), accompanied by its ubiquitination by the E3 ligases SCFbeta-TrCP and SCF-Tome-1, and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (3). The involvement of aberrant cell cycle control and unchecked DNA damage in cancer initiation and progression, and the finding of reduced Wee1 expression in colon carcinoma cells (5), suggest that Wee1 may act as a tumor suppressor. Cancer cells often respond to DNA-damaging treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation by implementing cell cycle arrest. These cells become resistant to apoptosis, and the above conventional therapies are rendered ineffective. Thus, the identification of probes that selectively increase levels of Wee1 may provide a potent route for cell cycle-based cancer therapy._||_Compounds that inhibit Wee1 degradation will provide information about the role of Wee1 in mitotic entry and cell cycle progression. The hypothesis is based on studies which show that Wee1 stabilization inhibits mitotic entry (6). A review of currently published scientific manuscripts reveals only one small molecule reported to stabilize Wee1 in HeLa cells: the dihydropteridinone BI 2536 (7, 8). The mechanism of action is unknown and the compound is not commercially available. In contrast, several reports demonstrate that Wee1 inhibition by compounds that block the G2/M checkpoint improve the cytotoxic effects of DNA damaging agents on p53-negative cells (9-12). However, these compounds are dual Src/Wee1 kinase inhibitors and cannot elucidate the specific role of Wee1 in cell cycle-related tumorigenesis. The liabilities of these compounds necessitate the discovery of high affinity, selective probes for Wee1 stabilization._||_References:_||_1. Lee MH, Yang HY.

Because Y2 receptors increase NPY transmission, the use of Y2 modulators may help to elucidate the anxiolytic-like effects of NPY in animal models (3).

In response to environmental stress, misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, leading to activation of a set of signaling cascades known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In eukaryotic cells the UPR reduces the burden of misfolded proteins by inhibiting protein synthesis and increasing clearance of misfolded proteins (3, 4). The RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) defines one branch of the UPR known as the integrated stress response (ISR) (2). During ER stress, the cytoplasmic kinase domain of PERK undergoes oligomerization and activating trans-autophosphorylation (5-7), leading to PERK-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of eIF2-alpha, and decreased protein translation (8-9). Studies showing that tumors derived from PERK-deficient cells are smaller than tumors from wildtype cells (9), and that PERK deficient mice die from diabetes resulting from accumulation of unfolded proteins (10), suggest that PERK may play a role in tumor growth and is essential for proper protein folding. Thus, the identification of selective inhibitors of PERK activity may provide insights into the biological roles of PERK and may lead to useful therapeutic candidates for protein misfolding disorders._||_References:_||_1.

Studies suggest that TRPML3 and TRPN1 channels have an important role in hearing and balance (4-7). Although TRPN1 is not present in the genomes of higher eukaryotes (8), TRPN1 orthologs were discovered in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and frog (Xenopus laevis) (9, 10). Studies showing that TRPN1-deficient zebrafish exhibit defective hair cell electrical traces, deafness and atypical swimming behavior resulting from impaired balance, suggest that TRPN1 has auditory and vestibular functions (10).

The protein tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is critical for this process (3-6). Following activation of cytokine receptors, particularly erythropoietin and interferon receptors, JAK2 phosphorylates transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family, leading to expression of target genes involved in immune cell homeostasis (2, 3). The discovery of acquired genetic mutations in the JAK2 gene in hematopoetic cells from patients with Myeloid Proliferative Disorders (MPDs) characterized by excess proliferation of differentiated bone marrow myeloid cells (7-10), provided insights into the role of JAK2 in hematopoiesis. The identified JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F) replaces guanine with thymine, resulting in a valine to phenylalanine amino acid substitution at codon 617 within the pseudokinase JH2 autoinhibitory domain (7-10). The resulting JAK2V617F variant is constitutively active, mediating JAK-STAT signaling efficiently even in the absence of ligand. Thus, the discovery of small molecules that can differentially inhibit JAK2V617F and not wildtype JAK2 may provide insights into JAK2 signaling in hematopoiesis and MPD pathogenesis (11, 12)._||_References:_||_1.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gαi and Gαo G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8). Thus, the identification of compounds that act as selective S1P4 agonists will provide insight into S1P4 biology and may serve as useful tools to limit lung tissue injury resulting from influenza infection._||_References:_||_1.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to G#i and G#o G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function._||_References:_||_1.

It is most often caused through unintended block of the cardiac repolarizing potassium channel, IKr, encoded by the Human Ether-a-go-go Related Gene (hERG) [4]. hERG is susceptible to inhibition by even transient exposure to a diverse array of common therapeutic compounds, including antihistamines, antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics, and antiarrhythmics which in turn provokes the life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia torsades de pointes in predisposed individuals. Indeed, several successful drugs (e.g., cisapride, seldane) had to be withdrawn from the market due to arrhythmia development caused by this mechanism [5-8]. Previous studies have shown that Ikr can be protected from block by known hERG antagonists through the activity of the K+ channel regulator 1 (KCR1) protein, which was characterized as an enzyme that is likely to function in the cellular glycosylation pathway[9, 10]. This finding led to a hypothesis that identification of a small molecule that mimics the activity of KCR1 and diminishes Ikr block by known hERG inhibitors may lead to the development of a co-drug to protect against the development of the aLQTS. Compounds that exhibit such activity would be expected to include neutral antagonists that bind to the same site as hERG blockers but do not favor the 'blocked conformation' of the pore, hERG agonists that competitively bind to the same site as hERG inhibitors, or compounds that prevent the access of a hERG inhibitor to its cognate binding site at the intracellular aspect of the pore region. High-throughput methods are used to:_||_1. Screen a library of 305,722 compounds for agents that increase the IC70 of the well-characterized hERG inhibitor, dofetilide, using a high-throughput Tl+ flux assay [11-13]. The Tl+ ion serves as a surrogate for K+ flux, and, when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader. A robust and reproducible assay in 384-well format has been developed to show a dose-dependent signal in response to dofetilide and tolerance to the compound vehicle, DMSO. Completion of a preliminary screen using 3,520 compounds demonstrated that the assay is ready to identify chemical compounds that alter the response of Ikr to dofetilide [14-17]._||_2. Determine if the isolated hits also affect the IC70 of a range of drugs with divergent chemical structures (moxifloxacin, clozapine[18], droperidol [5-6,19-21]) and clinical applications in the Tl+ flux assay._||_These findings will be validated through standard patch-clamp assays. Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) studies will be initiated around the most interesting chemical scaffolds._||_The development of a small molecule chemical agent that could be safely co-administered with clinically useful pharmaceuticals to protect susceptible patients from hERG inhibitors and the subsequent development of arrhythmias would improve public health and greatly facilitate the drug discovery process._||_Principle of the assay_||_Tl+ is permeable through potassium channels. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells and exhibits very low basal fluorescence in the absence of Tl+. Upon depolarization of cells expressing potassium channels, in this case, human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through activated hERG channels. The binding to Tl+ causes increase in fluorescence. If activity of hERG is potentiated by a test compound, the fluorescent signal increases; however, when the hERG channel is blocked by a test compound, low or no increase of the fluorescent signal is observed._||_1.

Outbreaks had been reported in Africa, Asia, and Europe since 1937.  In 1999, the first case of WNV was detected in New York City from which time the virus spread rapidly west resulting in the largest epidemics of neuroinvasive WNV disease ever reported in the US.  Currently, there is no vaccine for human use or antivirals that are available to treat WNV infections, leading to patient care which is mainly supportive. Hence this program will provide chemical probes from which to optimize leads for treatment of this emerging disease._||_ _||_To screen large compound libraries, a CPE based assay was developed in 384-plate format. The assay measures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in Vero E6 cells by WNV infection using cell viability as the end point. The screen for inhibitors of CPE caused by WNV infection involves challenging 3,000 cells with WNV virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. The WNV virus strain NY-99 stock was prepared from Vero E6 cells at the SRI BSL-3 facility. The assay includes both cell and virus controls and cell survival was measured 96 h post virus addition using CellTiterGlo viability reagent (Promega). Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100. The percent cell viability was taken as an assessment of antiviral activity. Library compounds were screened at 10 uM. ",

However, the number of ion channel drugs is strikingly small, compared to the number of ion channel genes.  Most of the known K+ channel modulators lack potency and specificity.  The reason for slow development of K+ channel drugs lies largely in the low capacity and high cost of electrophysiology-based screening techniques._||_The overall goal of the project is to discover inhibitors of the Kir2.1 channel with EC50 < 1 uM.  Identified compounds will serve as both a basis for development of clinical K+ channel drugs, and as a basic study of K+ channel physiology with novel mechanisms of action._||_The Kir2.1 channel (KCNJ2) is a member of inwardly-rectifying potassium channels, expressing two transmembrane-spanning segments, flanking a conserved pore region.  Inward rectifier K+ channels pass prominent inward currents, and mediate the cardiac inwardly-rectifying potassium current (IK1) [3], while outward currents are largely blocked.  The rectification process is mediated through blocking of the channel pore by intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines, and is specific for individual Kir subtypes [4, 5].  Specific modulators of the Kir2.1 channel serve as leads for development of anti-arrhythmic drugs, including drugs for treatment of short- and long-QT syndromes, as well as for the treatment of Andersen syndrome.  Several Kir2.1 inhibitor candidates have been discovered [6] [7], i.e. Chlorpromazine, Celastrol, and Gambogic acid.  However, a highly specific, high potency small molecule is still in need, not only for the mechanistic probing of the ion channel activities, but also to generate leads for therapeutics for related diseases._||_Principle of the assay_||_The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [8].  The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence.  Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels--in this case, inwardly-rectifying potassium ion channels (Kir2.1)--extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open Kir2.1 channels, and when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [9, 10].  If the activity of Kir2.1 is blocked/inhibited by a test compound, the fluorescent signal remains low/does not increase._||_Keywords:_||_Kir2.1, inward rectifying HTS assay, 384, primary, antagonist, inhibitor, blocker, FDSS, Thallium, fluorescence, Kinetic, FluxOR, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.

For example, targeting of opiod receptors by opiates such as morphine is a widespread clinical application for GPCR modulation in pain management. The recently de-orphanized GPR7 (5) is localized predominantly in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex (6), with additional expression in the pituitary, hippocampus, amygdala, and spinal cord (7-9). GPR7 is highly conserved in humans and rodents (6), and exhibits structural features of both GPCRs and somatostatin receptors (7). Studies identifying the energy-regulating neuropeptides Neuropeptide W (NPW) and Neuropeptide B (NPB) as endogenous ligands of GPR7 (5, 10), and the development of hyperphagia and obesity in male GPR7 knockout mice (11, 12), implicate GPR7 in feeding behavior. Additional studies identifying GPR7 expression in peripheral Schwann cells (13) and increased GPR7 expression in rat models and human patients with inflammation-associated neuropathic pain (11, 13), suggest a role for GPR7 in mediating the inflammatory pain response. The identification of modulators of GPR7 will provide useful tools to elucidate the diverse roles of this receptor in central neuropeptide signaling and nociception in general._||_References:_||_1.

1875,Luminescence Cell-Based Primary HTS to Identify Inhibitors of Polyadenylation,"Keywords: mRNA maturation, polyadenylation, reporter gene assay, yeast, gene expression_||_Assay:  Yeast which harbor a reporter construct will be screened for elevated levels of beta-galactosidase activity using the luminescent signal from the GalScreen assay.  Briefly, cells are lysed after incubation with compounds using the GalScreen reagent and then the luminescent signal is read on a plate reader._||_Expected Outcome:  Compounds which perturb polyadenylation will produce an elevated level of luminescent signal.  Toxic compounds and compounds that completely inhibit polyadenylation will not be detectable._||_In order to identify inhibitors of polyadenylation (Poly-A), yeast containing a reporter gene plasmid construct will be used for screening.  The pL101 plasmid contains a Poly-A site within an intron of the reporter gene construct (alcoholdehydrogenase (ADH2), containing the intron, upstream of  beta-galactosidase) and a Poly-A sequence at the reporter gene terminus.  When normal fidelity mRNA polyadenylation is the case, the intron will not be fully transcribed, since the poly-A site within the intron of the adh gene will cause the reporter gene mRNA to be matured prior to lac-Z transcription.  When Poly-A is inhibited, however, there will be readthrough of the first site, transcription of the full construct, and some maturation of the reporter gene.  So there should be  low levels of a beta-galactosidase reporter enzyme when polyadenylation is in its normal, uninhibited state and when polyadenylation is perturbed, higher levels.    The plasmid is described in Hyman, L. E., et al. Molecular and Cellular Biology (1991) 11, 4; 2004-2012.  The assay suffers from the drawback that if polyadenylation is completely inhibited, there will be no maturation of the reporter construct and thus no signal.    Positive control compound (Parish, C. A., et al, JACS (2008) 130, 22, 7060) is unavailable and the assay is, thus, impossible to fully optimize.",
1885,Luminescence Cell-Based/Microorganism Primary HTS to Identify Inhibitors of T.Cruzi Replication,"Keywords: Trypanosoma cruzi, Chagas disease_||_Assay Overview: The assay detects intracellular trypanosomes that are replicating inside host cells.  NIH3T3 cells are trypsinized, counted, and plated in 384-well tissue culture plates.  After plating the NIH3T3 cells, compounds are added to the wells.  T. cruzi that are genetically modified to express b-galactosidase are then harvested and active Trypomastigotes form  are counted and co-cultured with the NIH3T3 cells.  After 90 hours of co-culture, all cells in the well are lysed and b-galactosidase production is detected using a luminescent reporter system (GalScreen).  _||_Expected Outcome: Compounds significantly suppressing luminescence, and therefore b-galactosidases expression will be identified as hits in the screen.  Compounds that inhibit luminescence activity may kill T. cruzi, inhibit T. cruzi invasion or inhibit development of the parasite within the host cell. Compounds that are toxic to the host cell will be excluded in secondary assays.",

Test compounds that inhibit subsequent growth in the presence of fluconazole will merit further evaluation for their synergy with fluconazole. This whole cell phenotypic screening approach will only capture compounds that retain activity in biological media and are capable of entering and accumulating in fungi to bioactive concentrations. Grossly cytotoxic compounds will be removed through subsequent counterscreens.  Compound activity will be measured by the metabolism of Alamar Blue, a cell stain that is metabolized to a fluorescent product by living cells but that remains non-fluorescent in wells with growth-inhibited organisms._||_Probe attributes:_||_a.

They are also found in non-excitable tissues important for other functions such as hormone secretion, oxygen-sensing and immune responses. There are more than 100 genes in human genome encoding different but homologous potassium channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels, exemplified by the Shaker K+ channel, share considerable sequence similarity. Isolation and characterization of bioactive chemical probes could form important pharmacological foundation, providing a great deal of insights into the structure and function. _||_The KCNQ (or also called Kv7) channel family includes five members, KCNQ1 to KCNQ5; KCNQ are members of Kv channel superfamily[1-6]. Different from other Kv channel classes, KCNQ channels commonly display a sub-threshold opening (i.e., at a voltage near resting potential) and are regulated by GPCR signaling, e.g., muscarinic receptors [7, 8].  KCNQ2-5 channels are primarily expressed in the brain, while KCNQ1 is abundantly expressed in cardiac tissue.  Among congenital long QT patients, a disease which affects 1 in 2,500 live births, the most prevalent mutations are within the KCNQ1 allele. Mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are known to cause benign familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC), a rare form of epilepsy [9]. _||_Systemic compound screens for M-current have not been reported.  Because of the rapid progress of molecular cloning and functional characterization, KCNQ2 has been validated as the key molecular target of M-current.  It is therefore feasible to design non-biased high-throughput screens specifically targeting to KCNQ2 channels. This justifies use of the Tl+-based fluorescence assay in 384-well format by FDSS for the identification of modulatory compounds acting on KCNQ2 from a large compound library. _||_Principle of the assay_||_The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [10]. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence. Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open KCNQ2 channels,  and the KCNQ2 potassium channel, when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [11, 12].The binding to Tl+ causes increase in fluorescence. If activity of KCNQ2 is inhibited by a test compound, the fluorescent signal is suppressed._||_Keywords:_||_KCNQ2, HTS assay, 384, primary, antagonist, inhibitor, blocker, FDSS, Thallium, fluorescence, Kinetic, FluxOR, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.

TRP cationic channels are key molecules that are involved in a variety of diverse biological and pathological processes, ranging from neurological diseases [2], i.e. neuropathic pain [3], and cardiovascular diseases [4], to other diseases involving sensory physiology [5, 6]._||_Among the seven main subfamilies of TRP channels, separated according to structural homology, the TRPC (canonical) channels are among the first founding members of the TRP family [7, 8].  The TRPC subfamily is composed of seven members that are nonselective, calcium-permeable cation channels, which cause both a depolarization of the cell membrane potential and entry of calcium.  Disruption of TRPC function usually results in a change of risk factors in complex diseases, rather than an apparent phenotype.  The modulation of intracellular calcium as well as the membrane potential contributes to activation of transcription factors, apoptosis, vascular contractility, platelet activation, and cardiac hypertrophy, as well as normal and abnormal cell proliferation.  Currently there are no specific modulators available for TRPC isoforms, nor are there good common modulators available for all TRPC members [9]._||_The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that potentiate Ca2+ flux [10] in the presence of DAMGO at an EC20 concentration which, itself, minimally activates TRPC4 cation channels.  These compounds are considered, potentially, as allosteric potentiators/activators for TRPC4 cation channels._||_Principle of the assay_||_To screen the allosteric activator/potentiator of the TRPC4 cation channels, a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses both TRPC4beta and mu-Opioid receptor was employed for the specific activation of TRPC4 cation channel.  Approximate 20% of activation is obtained by the application of DAMGO in an EC20 concentration. The TRPC4 cation channel activity was monitored by calcium flux with a commercial Fluo 4 kit [10].  Any compounds shown to increase the Fluo 4 fluorescence in the presence of DAMGO at EC20 concentrations were considered as allosteric hits for TRPC4.  Allosteric mu-Opioid receptor activators/potentiators will may be excluded through the counter- screen against HEK293 stable cells expressing the mu-Opioid receptor alone. _||_Keywords:_||_TRPC4, mu-Opioid receptor, HTS assay, 384, primary, agonist, activator, potentiator, allosteric, FDSS, Calcium, fluorescence, Kinetic, Fluo 4, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.

They are also found in non-excitable tissues important for other functions such as hormone secretion, oxygen-sensing and immune responses. There are more than 100 genes in human genome encoding different but homologous potassium channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels, exemplified by the Shaker K+ channel, share considerable sequence similarity. Isolation and characterization of bioactive chemical probes could form important pharmacological foundation, providing a great deal of insights into the structure and function. _||_The KCNQ (or also called Kv7) channel family includes five members, KCNQ1 to KCNQ5; KCNQ are members of Kv channel superfamily[1-6]. Different from other Kv channel classes, KCNQ channels commonly display a sub-threshold opening (i.e., at a voltage near resting potential) and are regulated by GPCR signaling, e.g., muscarinic receptors [7, 8].  KCNQ2-5 channels are primarily expressed in the brain, while KCNQ1 is abundantly expressed in cardiac tissue.  Among congenital long QT patients, a disease which affects 1 in 2,500 live births, the most prevalent mutations are within the KCNQ1 allele. Mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are known to cause benign familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC), a rare form of epilepsy [9]. _||_In the mid-90s, a compound known as D-23129, or retigabine, was initially developed to target GABAnergic signaling [10, 11].  Despite its poor effect on the GABA pathway, retigabine was shown to have potent anti-convulsant activity. In 1997, retigabine was also found to induce the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels at resting membrane potentials, and since then, through a variety of other studies, this has been established to be its main mechanism of action.  Retigabine, acting on KCNQ2/3 potassium channels which code M-currents, is now being used for treatment of epilepsy.  None of the anti-convulsants that are in clinical use today have a comparable mechanism of action, i.e., through ligand activation of voltage-gated potassium channels.  Several potentiation compounds are synthesized according to the scaffold of retigabine. However, considering the poor potency of retigabine and several other undesirable characteristics including its broad action on KCNQ2, 3, 4, and 5 [12], it is not clear whether these related structures will fundamentally improve therapeutic efficacy.  Hence, it argues for the performance of a non-biased screen for new structures with potentiation activity._||_Systemic compound screens for M-current have not been reported.  Because of the rapid progress of molecular cloning and functional characterization, KCNQ2 has been validated as the key molecular target of M-current.  It is therefore feasible to design non-biased high-throughput screens specifically targeting to KCNQ2 channels. This justifies use of the Tl+-based fluorescence assay in 384-well format by FDSS for the identification of modulatory compounds acting on KCNQ2 from a large compound library. _||_Principle of the assay_||_The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [13]. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence. Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open KCNQ2 channels,  and the KCNQ2 potassium channel, when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [14, 15].The binding to Tl+ causes increase in fluorescence. If activity of KCNQ2 is potentiated by a test compound, the fluorescent signal increases._||_Keywords:_||_KCNQ2, HTS assay, 384, primary, agonist, activator, potentiator, FDSS, Thallium, fluorescence, Kinetic, FluxOR, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.

2391,A Cell Based HTS Approach for the Discovery of New Inhibitors of Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),"Southern Research's Specialized Biocontainment Screening Center (SRSBSC)_||_Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, Alabama)_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network (MLPCN)_||_Assay Provider: Dr. William Severson, Southern Research Institute _||_Grant number:  1 R03 MH082403-01A1_||_Assay Rationale and Summary:  Currently, there are no commercially available vaccines to protect humans against Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants and children under one year of age.  Nevertheless, severe lower respiratory tract disease may occur at any age, especially among the elderly or among those with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems. The existing therapies for the acute infection are ribavirin and the prophylactic humanized monoclonal antibody (Synagis from MedImmune) that is limited to use in high risk pediatric patients.  The economic impact of RSV infections due to hospitalizations and indirect medical costs is greater than $ 650 million annually.  The assay provider has developed and validated a 384-well cell-based assay that measures CPE induced in HEp-2 cells by RSV infection, using a luminescent-based detection system for signal endpoint.  We anticipate that the proposed studies utilizing the Molecular Libraries Probes Production Network (MLPCN) HTS resources will generate multiple scaffolds targeting various junctures in the RSV viral lifecycle.  These may be furthered developed into probes to construct novel single or combination therapeutics.  ",

Certain GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways for neuropeptides such as oxytocin, serotonin, and vasopressin, and influence complex social behaviors such as trust, anxiety, and parenting (5). Oxytocin receptor (OXTR: OTR) activity is mediated by G proteins (Gαq, Gαi, and Gβγ) which activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (6, 7). OTR belongs to the class A (rhodopsin-like) GPCR family shared with the vasopressin receptors (8), and is expressed in the brain, uterus, and mammary glands. Studies showing a role for OTR in autism (9), defective lactation and nurturing behavior (10), and altered social behavior and aggression (10) suggest that the identification of small molecules that act as agonists of OTR activity may serve as useful tools in OTR biology and as potential therapeutic agents for human behavioral disorders._||_References:_||_1.

Studies showing a role for OTR in autism (9), defective lactation and nurturing behavior (10), and altered social behavior and aggression (10) suggest that the identification of small molecules that act as potentiators of OTR activity may serve as useful tools in OTR biology and as potential therapeutic agents for human behavioral disorders._||_References:_||_1.

Expression of activator BH3-only proteins, such as BIM or tBID, leads to downstream caspase activation and apoptosis. A1 can functionally bind to and sequester BIM or tBID. In this assay, the parental control cells do not depend on A1 for survival. However, they can be primed to depend on A1 by co-expressing A1 and BIM. The primed cells still maintain a balance between anti and pro-apoptotic proteins, but rely on A1 to sequester BIM._||_An A1 inhibitor causes the release of A1-bound BIM, which activates BAX/BAK, and leads to caspase activation that can be quantitatively measured using a luciferin-linked caspase substrate (peptide sequence DEVD) available commercially as Promega's Caspase Glo 3/7 reagent._||_ _||_Expected Outcome:  Compounds that cause caspase activation will show an increase in luminescence signal as measured by the caspase glo reagent.  Additional assays will determine whether this caspase activation is being caused by general toxicity or off target effects (as is the case for the nonspecific positive control, clofoctol) or due to the on-target disruption of the A1-BIM interaction (as is the case for the specific but weaker positive control, ABT-263, which mimics the BH3 homology domain of BIM.)",10018

Individual subtypes of these potassium channels often have a unique expression pattern allowing cells to 'fine-tune' membrane potentials and excitability according to their respective physiological functions [4]. Dysfunctions of these electrical excitability controlling proteins, either congenital or acquired, are attributed to a variety of diseases [5,6], such as cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes, hypertension, and epilepsy. Specific modulation of individual potassium channel types therefore represents an enormous potential for the development of physiological tool compounds and new drugs [7-9]._||_KCNQ1 (Kv7.1, KvLQT) [10,11] is an alpha-subunit subtype of voltage-gated KCNQ potassium channel family, which is composed of five members of KCNQ1-KCNQ5. They share between 30% and 65% amino acid identity. A classical KCNQ alpha-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments, including a voltage-sensor segment and a pore domain [12-15]. Unique from other members of KCNQ family [16], KCNQ1 has been generally absent from neuronal tissues, mainly expressed in heart, kidney, small intestine, pancreas, prostate and other non-excitable epithelial tissues. Also contrast to other members of KCNQ family which form both alpha-subunit homo- and heterotetrameric channels, KCNQ1 channels only form alpha-subunit homotetramers [10]. They commonly co-assemble with beta-subunit KCNE proteins to give rise to functional variations in different tissues._||_These molecular assemblies have afforded KCNQ1 with two important physiological functions: 1) repolarization of the cardiac tissue following an action potential and 2) water and salt transport in epithelial tissues. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary long QT syndrome, diabetics [18], Romano-Ward syndrome, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome [19] and familial atrial fibrillation [20], as well as impairment of cyclic AMP-stimulated intestinal secretion of chloride ions related to cystic fibrosis [21,22] and pathological forms of secretary diarrhea [23-25]. Furthermore, drug-induced acquired KCNQ1 and KCNQ1/KCNE dysfunctions also raise concerns of KCNQ1/KCNE as potential hERG-like drug safety issue in pharmaceutical development [17]._||_For their pharmacological responses, KCNQ1/KCNE heteromultimers function differently from KCNQ1 alone. Initial discovery of KCNQ1 modulators is focused on the KCNQ1 (and KCNQ1/KCNE1 IKs) inhibitors [17], from earlier Chromonal 293B[26], linopirdine and XE991[27], to new family of potent inhibitors, i.e. Merck-IKs (IC50 ~0.08 nM), JNJ 303(IC50 0.064 uM) and JNJ282 (IC50 0.001 uM). _||_Systemic compound screens for KCNQ1 and its heteromultimers have not been reported. Here the assay, Tl+-based fluorescence assay in 384 format by FDSS, therefore, was used for the identification of inhibitory compounds acting on KCNQ1 from a large MLSMR compound library. _||_Principle of the assay_||_The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [28]. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence. Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels, in this case, KCNQ1 potassium channel, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open KCNQ1 channels, and when bound to the dye, produce a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [29, 30]._||_Keywords:_||_KCNQ1, HTS assay, 384, primary, antagonist, inhibitor, FDSS, Thallium, fluorescence, Kinetic, FluxOR, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, MLSMR, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.

Under conditions such as environmental stress and exposure to endogenous toxins, transcription factors can rapidly modulate the transcription of genes whose products regulate cell proliferation and metabolism. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix protein superfamily involved in the biological response to aromatic hydrocarbons, and regulates the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450, aldehyde dehydrogenase, quinone reductase, and other phase I and phase II detoxification genes (2, 3). In response to various compounds, including the environmental pollutants dioxins, benzo(a)pyrene, dietary contaminants, grapefruit juice, endogenous toxins, and plant products such as carotinoids, nicotine and caffeine (2, 4-6), cytosolic AHR complexes with chaperones hsp90, p23, and XAP2, translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) to influence target gene transcription (7, 8). Gain-of-function studies in mice reveal the oncogenic potential of AHR (9), while other reports show roles for AHR in diverse biologic events such as organ development (10, 11), immune function and allergy (12), and estrogen responsiveness (13). The identification of agonists of AHR will provide useful tools to elucidate the roles of this receptor in cell metabolism, transcriptional control, and tumor formation._||_References:_||_1.

Certain GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways for neuropeptides such as oxytocin, serotonin, and vasopressin, and influence complex social behaviors such as trust, anxiety, and parenting (5). Oxytocin receptor (OXTR: OTR) activity is mediated by G proteins (Gαq, Gαi, and Gβγ) which activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (6, 7). OTR belongs to the class A (rhodopsin-like) GPCR family shared with the vasopressin receptors (8), and is expressed in the brain, uterus, and mammary glands. Studies showing a role for OTR in autism (9), defective lactation and nurturing behavior (10), and altered social behavior and aggression (10) suggest that the identification of small molecules that act as agonists of OTR activity may serve as useful tools in OTR biology and as potential therapeutic agents for human behavioral disorders._||_References:_||_1.

The steady-state levels of AB reflect a balance between its production via beta- and gamma-secretases and its catabolism by proteolytic degradation (2-4). Because Abeta cleavage products are less neurotoxic than intact Abeta, enzymes that cleave Abeta are of therapeutic interest for AD. In fact, upregulation of Abeta-degrading proteases can prevent AD-like pathology in beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (5), suggesting that enhancing AB degradation may be therapeutic in human AD. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an Abeta-degrading zinc metalloprotease that requires a free thiol and bivalent cations to degrade extracellular Abeta in neurons and other cell types (6-8). The deduced sequence of IDE shares little homology to other proteinases, including cysteine, metallo-, serine, or aspartic proteases (9). Most IDE is localized inside the cell (10), where it can degrade internalized insulin (11), insulin-like growth factors I and II (12), and amylin (13), which make IDE an attractive target for type-2 diabetes. However, since IDE has also been found in the extracellular space and at the plasma membrane (6), it can function as a principal protease in Abeta catabolism (5, 14, 15). IDE secretion is not dependent upon the classical secretion pathway (16). Studies showing reduced IDE levels in human AD patients (17, 18), combined with increased brain AB levels in IDE-deficient mice (14, 15), and association studies suggesting that IDE variants may be associated with AD severity (19-23), suggest that the identification of compounds that selectively modulate IDE activity will present as important tools for the study of IDE function, AD, and diabetes._||_References:_||_1.

Most non-sensory GPCRs are expressed in the brain and regulate critical neuronal functions involved in feeding, sleep, mood, and addiction (5, 6). For example, in the later al hypothalamic region of the brain, two orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) derived from proteolytic processing of the same orexin precursor (7), signal through the Gq-coupled GPCRs OX1R and OX2R to stimulate food consumption (8, 9). OX1R binds orexin A selectively, while OX2R binds both orexin A and orexin B. Recently, signaling by orexin A through OX1R has been shown to play a critical role in cocaine-seeking behavior (10) and morphine withdrawal (6). Additional studies reveal OX1R involvement in behavioral plasticity (11), the sleep-wake cycle (12, 13), and gastric acid secretion (14), and that OX1R may bind other neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y and secretin (15). As a result, the identification of a selective OX1R antagonist would serve as a useful tool for exploring orexin biology, and the role of OX1R in drug addiction._||_References:_||_1.

Most non-sensory GPCRs are expressed in the brain and regulate critical neuronal functions involved in feeding, sleep, mood, and addiction (5, 6). For example, in the later al hypothalamic region of the brain, two orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) derived from proteolytic processing of the same orexin precursor (7), signal through the Gq-coupled GPCRs OX1R and OX2R to stimulate food consumption (8, 9). OX1R binds orexin A selectively, while OX2R binds both orexin A and orexin B. Recently, signaling by orexin A through OX1R has been shown to play a critical role in cocaine-seeking behavior (10) and morphine withdrawal (6). Additional studies reveal OX1R involvement in behavioral plasticity (11), the sleep-wake cycle (12, 13), and gastric acid secretion (14), and that OX1R may bind other neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y and secretin (15). As a result, the identification of a selective OX1R antagonist would serve as a useful tool for exploring orexin biology, and the role of OX1R in drug addiction._||_References:_||_1.

The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) are a key family of modulators and scaffolds for GPCRs which have been identified by many authors as appealing drug targets [1-5]. RGS proteins bind to activated G proteins and strongly inhibit their signals by catalyzing the hydrolysis of bound GTP [6-7]. Consistent with this mode of action, genetic deletion of RGS greatly enhances receptor signaling [8-10]. Furthermore, RGS proteins display isoform-specific tissue distribution [11-14] and their expression is altered in pathophysiological states including Parkinson's disease [15], neuropathic pain [16-17], schizophrenia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure [18]. An activator of RGS action would be expected to suppress the function of GPCR agonists such as vasoactivators, inflammatory mediators, endogenous neurotransmitters, or catecholamines such as L-DOPA. It has recently been established that loss of function of RGS2 causes hypertensive symptoms in mice [19] and may contribute to vasoactive disorders in humans as well [20-22]. Also, reduced expression of RGS4 has been correlated with schizophrenia [23-24]. Consequently, compounds that could either enhance the function of RGS proteins or could increase their expression might be of therapeutic benefit. The identification of selective modulators of RGS proteins would also greatly facilitate experimental studies of this sizeable protein family (with 20-30 members) by permitting rapid and specific chemical potentiation. Such RGS modulators would be particularly useful to determine which RGS proteins modulate particular receptor signaling pathways._||_The goal of this project is to identify potentiators /activators of the regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4), using a receptor-stimulated cell-based Ca++ assay._||_References:_||_[1].

463193,High-content cell-based screening for modulators of autophagy,"Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy herein) is a fundamental biological phenomenonthat significantly impacts energy metabolism and intracellular homeostasis.  Morphologically, autophagy is defined by electron microscopy as a double membrane structure (autophagosome) that captures cytoplasm, subcellular organelles, or even intracellular pathogens, which eventually fuses with the lysosome, leading to the degradation of its content.  Research in the last decade has defined a core machinery of autophagy, which involves two conjugation systems: the Atg5-Atg12-Atg16 and the Atg8-PE.  Because of its rapid translocation from the cytosol at the initiation stage to the autophagosomal membranes and its continuous presence in the vacuole until degradation, Atg8, or a mammalian homolog, LC3B, has become favorable molecular marker for autophagy, particularly in mammalian cells, in which no other markers can be monitored in a real time fashion (Klionsky et al., 2008).  Nonetheless, many fundamental issues are still unresolved regarding the molecular mechanisms of autophagy.  _||_Studies in mammalian cells have now accumulated compelling evidence that autophagy is intimately involved in the pathogenesis in such prevailing diseases as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and intracellular microbial infections.  Modulation of autophagy has resulted in changes in disease course, which leads to the hope that this could open up new therapeutic venues.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of good compounds or drugs that could be used clinically.  Most of the agents that are known to modulate autophagy are indirectly affecting the autophagy machinery, or have non-specific targets.  This issue is further compounded by our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of autophagy in different settings regarding its initiation and regulation, which renders the search for compounds against specific targets difficult.  _||_We have developed a cell-based high-content screen that can be performed reproducibly in microtiter plate-based format with robotic liquid handling. The assay is a high-content imaging assay based on changes in the cellular localization of GFP-LC3B from a diffuse cytosolic to a membrane-associated, punctate pattern (Klionsky et al., 2008).

Most non-sensory GPCRs are expressed in the brain and regulate critical neuronal functions involved in feeding, sleep, mood, and addiction (5, 6). For example, in the lateral hypothalamic region of the brain, two orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) derived from proteolytic processing of the same orexin precursor (7), signal through the Gq-coupled GPCRs OX1R and OX2R to stimulate food consumption (8, 9). OX1R binds orexin A selectively, while OX2R binds both orexin A and orexin B. Recently, signaling by orexin A through OX1R has been shown to play a critical role in cocaine-seeking behavior (10) and morphine withdrawal (6). Additional studies reveal OX1R involvement in behavioral plasticity (11), the sleep-wake cycle (12, 13), and gastric acid secretion (14), and that OX1R may bind other neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y and secretin (15). As a result, the identification of a selective OX1R antagonist would serve as a useful tool for exploring orexin biology, and the role of OX1R in drug addiction._||_References:_||_1.

One possible way to mitigate the progression of prion based diseases, such as Creuzfeld-Jakob disease, is to reduce the overall levels of PrP in the nerve cells.  Here the approach is to accomplish this by inhibiting the expression of PrP at the level of message translation.  To identify compounds which may reduce translation of the PrP message, compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid reporter construct.  The reporter consisted of a stem-loop sequence from the human Prion protein variant 2 (PRP) 5'UTR fused to a luciferase gene as well as a viral internal ribosome entry site driving Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP, signal not used in this assay) (Provided by Jack Rogers).  The screen looked to identify compounds which interact with the PRP 5' UTR and reduce protein expression by observing luciferase activity using a commercial assay kit (Steady Glo, Promega).",

For example, KCNK9 is overexpressed in various human cancers and its exogenous overexpression promotes cell proliferation in culture and tumor development in animal models [3-4]. Moreover, KCNK9 deficiency causes a primary hyperaldosteronism in mouse [5].  A more recent study reports that KCNK9 mutation causes Birk Barel mental retardation dysmorphism syndrome in humans [6]. These findings suggest that KCNK9 may be a potential new therapeutic target for treating human diseases [7].  However, there are no suitable chemical probes to investigate the physiological roles of KCNK9 channels. _||_The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that inhibit the flow of ions through KCNK9 using a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses this channel.  Compounds selected as KCNK9 inhibitors will later be counter-screened for specificity._||_Principle of the assay_||_Thallium based assays exploit the inherent permeability of potassium channels for another cation[8-9]. In the current work, we have used the FluxOR (Invitrogen) dye to detect changes in intracellular thallium levels. To assess potassium channel function, cells are initially loaded with FluxOR dye and incubated with test compounds prior to fluorescence signal recording.  An extracellular solution containing both thallium and potassium is then added, which depolarizes the membrane and consequently causes activation of potassium channels.  The electrochemical gradient drives the net inflow of thallium down its concentration gradient.  The accumulation of intracellular thallium will increase the fluorescence of the FluxOR dye.  In this way, the thallium signal is used as an indicator for the function of thallium permeable proteins, a method commonly used to reflect the activity of recombinantly expressed cation channels.  _||_Keywords:_||_KCNK9, TASK3, Two-pore domain potassium channel 9, HTS assay, 384, primary, inhibitor, blocker, FDSS, Thallium, fluorescence, Kinetic, FluxOR, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.

The steady-state levels of AB reflect a balance between its production via beta- and gamma-secretases and its catabolism by proteolytic degradation (2-4). Because AB cleavage products are less neurotoxic than intact AB, enzymes that cleave AB are of therapeutic interest for AD. In fact, upregulation of AB-degrading proteases can prevent AD-like pathology in beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (5), suggesting that enhancing AB degradation may be therapeutic in human AD. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an AB-degrading zinc metalloprotease that requires a free thiol and bivalent cations to degrade extracellular AB in neurons and other cell types (6-8). The deduced sequence of IDE shares little homology to other proteinases, including cysteine, metallo-, serine, or aspartic proteases (9). Most IDE is localized inside the cell (10), where it can degrade internalized insulin (11), insulin-like growth factors I and II (12), and amylin (13), which make IDE an attractive target for type-2 diabetes. However, since IDE has also been found in the extracellular space and at the plasma membrane (6), it can function as a principal protease in AB catabolism (5, 14, 15). IDE secretion is not dependent upon the classical secretion pathway (16). Studies showing reduced IDE levels in human AD patients (17, 18), combined with increased brain AB levels in IDE-deficient mice (14, 15), and association studies suggesting that IDE variants may be associated with AD severity (19-23), suggest that the identification of compounds that selectively modulate IDE activity will present as important tools for the study of IDE function, AD, and diabetes (24)._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1).

The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6).

For consistency with the primary assay in which these compounds were identified, after 30min exposure to small molecules, proteasome inhibitor MG132 is added to elicit a stress response*.

Potential false positives in this assay included those compounds which act not by specifically inducing HSF-1, but by stabilizing luciferase or are broad spectrum inducers of transcription/translation, or act solely through interaction with MG132 to potentiate stress response.",

EBV infection mimics NF-kB hyperactivation states present in many malignancies. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-kB pathways in a ligand-independent fashion.  LMP1 is expressed in most EBV-associated  lymphoproliferative and epithelial malignancies. LMP1 activates NF-kB via two cytoplasmic signaling domains. The membrane proximal 'TES1' domain activates a non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway, while the membrane distal 'TES2' domain activates canonical NF-kappaB._||_The primary screen uses a stably transfected HEK293 cell line with a doxycycline & 4-hydroxytamoxifen inducible LMP1 TES2 construct and a NF-kappaB luciferase reporter. Induction of the system will activate the NF-kappaB pathway and result in expression of the luciferase reporter gene. Inhibitors of the the pathway will block expression of the reporter construct._||_Expected Outcome: Inhibitors of the LMP1 pathway will show a reduction in luminescence measured by a commercial luciferase kit (SteadyGlo, Promega.)  Later assays will determine whether this loss of signal is due to inhibition of the pathway of interest or due to off-target or general toxicity effects.",3783750

As such they initiate homeostatic responses but also pathologic responses. Our focus on TLR9 is based on its role in autoimmune disease. Auto-antibodies to DNA, RNA, or both are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1). Auto-antibody production depends on the endosomal TLRs such as TLR9 and TLR7 that bind DNA (TLR9) or RNA (TLR7). Identifying specific inhibitors of TLR9 is important for furthering the understanding of SLE. To date, with one exception, all the non-protein molecules that alter TLR responses are ligand analogs that react with the extra-cytoplasmic ligand binding portions of the TLRs. The sole exception, TAK-242, is a TLR4 inhibitor that was withdrawn from further development as a drug (http://www.takeda.com, Feb. 20, 2009) for unspecified reasons. The assays we are developing are designed to identify small molecules that interfere with the first interaction of the receptor with the proximal intracellular signaling adapter, which in the case of TLR9 is MyD88. Such inhibitors will not be competitive with receptor ligands. They have the potential to be highly specific in their action among members of the TLR family because the interactions of MyD88 with each TLR member are unique, despite the structural similarities in the family (2). The rationale for this approach is that it will permit the identification of a new class of inhibitors enabling a variety of innovative approaches to research and therapeutics, not only for SLE, but also for other immunological processes in which the TLRs are involved._||_References:_||_1.

Of interest, DAX-1 (NR0B1; nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1; dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome gene 1) is an orphan nuclear receptor shown to act as a robust transcriptional repressor, inhibiting genes involved in steroidogenesis through interaction with corepressors and regulating the pluripotency of stem cells (4-8). The human DAX-1 gene encodes a protein whose C terminus is similar to the LBD of nuclear hormone receptors, while its N terminus is composed of three cysteine-rich 70 amino acids with little similarity to known proteins (4, 7). Mutations in DAX-1 have been shown to cause the X-linked form of adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC), associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HHG). AHC-HHG-associated mutations share an altered DAX-1 C-terminal domain (5, 9), resulting in loss of transcriptional repression activity (5, 7, 9), which suggests that impairment of the DAX-1 transcriptional activity is directly linked to AHC-HHG pathogenesis. In addition, DAX-1 is highly expressed in pediatric Ewing tumors (10). As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of DAX-1 will serve as useful tools to elucidate its roles of in steroidogenesis, tumorigenesis, and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency (8)._||_References:_||_1.

Cells normally take up HDL via the SR-B1 scavenger receptor in 2 to 3 hours.  After significant uptake of the DiI-HDL, cells become fluorescent.  The level of fluorescence correlates with the amount of HDL uptake and can be measured with the Perkin Elmer Envision plate reader.  The uptake can be inhibited with the compound BLT-1 or the fluorescence can be reduced when co-treated with an excess of unlabeled HDL.  mSR-BI cells are a CHO cell line that lacks expression of the LDL receptors and overexpresses the scavenger receptor, SR-BI.  mSR-BI cells are exposed to compound for 3 hours.  DiI labeled HDL is added to the well at a final of 10 ug/mL. Inhibtors of SR-B1 and HDL uptake will have a reduction in fluorescence.",20778

GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases._||_References:_||_1.

FRDA is associated with progressive neurological disability, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased risk of diabetes mellitus, severe disruption of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis, mitochondrial iron overload coupled to cellular iron dysregulation, and an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (1, 2). FRDA results from severely reduced levels of frataxin, a small, highly conserved mitochondrial protein of uncharacterized function (3). Transcriptional silencing of the FXN gene is induced by expansion of GAA repeats in the first FXN intron (3, 4), and inhibits FXN expression through a heterochromatin-mediated repression mechanism (5). Importantly, the FXN coding sequence is intact and capable of expressing functional frataxin. FRDA patients homozygous for the GAA expansion have very low frataxin mRNA and protein levels when compared with heterozygous carriers and healthy controls. Thus far, a limited number of compounds have been shown to alleviate GAA-induced transcriptional silencing in vitro (6-9). As there are no treatments that have been shown to stop the progression of FRDA, the objective of this project is to identify new pharmacological probes able to stimulate gene expression blocked by pathologically expanded GAA repeats. This project can lead to the discovery of new compounds with therapeutic activity in FRDA and may be applicable in the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for Fragile X syndrome, other neurological diseases, as well as cancer._||_References:_||_1.

However, one of the most pressing limitations of currently established chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer is the fact that breast cancers frequently acquire resistance to antiestrogens (5, 6). Nuclear receptors (NR) and other hormone receptors mediate their cellular effects in part through the interaction with coactivators which increase their transcriptional activity. The best characterized coactivator family is the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family (7). Given the central role that SRC-3 plays in breast and other cancers, the search for small molecule agents that target SRC-1 and SRC-3 represent an innovative and potentially effective strategy to identify agents to treat hormone-refractory breast cancers and other cancers where these coactivators are overexpressed. Compounds that target the function of steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) protein promise to be different because cancer cells are less likely to bypass the comprehensive disruption of multiple growth factor signaling systems that result from the loss of SRC-3 function. In contrast to the goal of screens that seek to interfere with NR-coactivator interactions, the work proposed here aims to identify compounds that specifically target the coactivators themselves. This approach offers to be more broadly applicable. For instance, SRC-1 or SRC-3 typically remains overexpressed in ER negative cancers or acts as a coactivator for other oncogenic transcription factors (8). SMIs that target ERa, on the other hand are largely predicted to duplicate the biological action of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen._||_References:_||_1. Arteaga, C.L., A.K. Tandon, D.D.

However, one of the most pressing limitations of currently established chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer is the fact that breast cancers frequently acquire resistance to antiestrogens (5, 6). Nuclear receptors (NR) and other hormone receptors mediate their cellular effects in part through the interaction with coactivators which increase their transcriptional activity. The best characterized coactivator family is the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family (7). Given the central role that SRC-3 plays in breast and other cancers, the search for small molecule agents that target SRC-1 and SRC-3 represent an innovative and potentially effective strategy to identify agents to treat hormone-refractory breast cancers and other cancers where these coactivators are overexpressed. Compounds that target the function of steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) protein promise to be different because cancer cells are less likely to bypass the comprehensive disruption of multiple growth factor signaling systems that result from the loss of SRC-3 function. In contrast to the goal of screens that seek to interfere with NR-coactivator interactions, the work proposed here aims to identify compounds that specifically target the coactivators themselves. This approach offers to be more broadly applicable. For instance, SRC-1 or SRC-3 typically remains overexpressed in ER negative cancers or acts as a coactivator for other oncogenic transcription factors (8). SMIs that target ERa, on the other hand are largely predicted to duplicate the biological action of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen._||_References:_||_1. Arteaga, C.L., A.K. Tandon, D.D.

Abnormality of CaCC activity is thought to be causal or linked to several major diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and hypertension. Its roles are implicated in numerous physiological processes including cardiac and neuronal excitation, sensory transduction, trans-epithelial secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and fertilization.  Discovery of CaCC-specific chemical probes can provide not only useful tool molecules for pharmacological interrogation of the CaCC function and diversity, but may also provide compounds as starting points for therapeutic efforts to treat various diseases resulting from dysfunction in chloride transport. _||_Our objective is to find potent and specific small molecule chemical probes that modulate TMEM16A-based calcium-activated chloride channel, by performing a primary screen of the MLSMR library of 300,000 compounds to identify small molecules and structural scaffolds that modulate this calcium-activated chloride channel; and examining and identifying hits with preferential effects on TMEM16A versus other chloride channels after validation, confirmatory and counter-screens._||_Despite the discovery of the molecular identity of CaCC, it is broadly recognized that there are only few limited CaCC/TMEM16A inhibitors/blockers available. Only until recently that CaCC (TMEM16A) modulators have been reported (10-12), including 1) Niflumic acid (non-specific, 17 uM, PMID: 18959787); 2) 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (Non-specific; 10.3uM); 3) 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB, Non-specific, 22-68 uM); ;4) DIDS (Non-specific, 48/10.7 uM, PMID18959787); 5) Flufenamic acid (N-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)anthranilic acid, Non-specific, 28 uM); 6) Digallic acid (TMEM16A; 3.6 uM, PMID: 20581223; 21084298); 7) Tannic acid (TMEM16A, 6.1uM, PMID: 20581223; 21084298); and 8) T16Ainh-A01 (TMEM16A, 1.1uM, PMID: 20581223; 21084298). Most are non-specific inhibitors and were discovered without the information of the molecular identity of the CaCCs, except the last three in the table which were reported after the current application. Still, potent and specific CaCC inhibitors are in need._||_Principle of the assay_||_The iodide ion, which is permeable through the TMEM16A channel, serves as a surrogate for Cl-flux. The iodide flux is detected by YFP Iodide Biosensors (YFP mutant at H148Q/ I152L)(13). The activation of the TMEM16A by ionomycin (or ATP) triggers the channel opening and I- influx, and consequentially the quenching of the mutant YFP fluorescence. Any compounds which inhibit/block the TMEM16A channels will result in reduced quenching and higher remaining fluorescence as detected by imaging plate reader FDSS (14). _||_Assay overview:_||_The purpose of this assay is to identify test compounds that inhibit/block the calcium-activated chloride channel (TMEM16A). This assay employs a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses TMEM16A channels. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular iodide, as monitored by a iodide-sensitive fluorescent protein YFP mutant at H148Q/ I152L. Those HEK293 cells stably expressing TMEM16A channels were plated into 384-well plates. On the following day, cells were incubated with assay buffer after removing media. Compounds were added to the assay buffer. Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and fluorescence changes measured upon the addition of trigger solution (0.5 uM ionomycin in 16 mM iodide final in the well). The fluorescence of YFP was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated YFP fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound causes more than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an inhibitor/blocker of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channels._||_Keywords:_||_CaCC, TMEM16A, ANO-1, anoctamine-1, chloride channel, calcium, calcium activated chloride channel, HTS assay, counter, CHO-K1, 384, primary, antagonist, inhibitor, FDSS, fluorescence, Kinetic, YFP, quenching, YFP biosensor, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, MLSMR, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.Schroeder, B.C., et al., Expression Cloning of TMEM16A as a Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Subunit.

Primary sensory neurons in DRG play an essential role in generating pain and itch by detecting painful or itchy stimuli through their peripheral axons in the skin and sending signals to the spinal cord via their central axons. _||_Several complementary lines of evidence suggest that Mrgs function as endogenous inhibitors of persistent pain [1]. Particularly, spinal cord application of BAM8-22 in mice strongly inhibited the wind-up response of wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the spinal cord, and significantly attenuated inflammatory hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain in an Mrg-dependent manner. BAM8-22, a 15 amino acid endogenous peptide, is a specific agonist for mouse MrgC11 and human MrgX1 [2, 3]. Agonists[4,5] for Mrgs may represent a new class of anti-hyperalgesics for chronic pain, which could suppress central sensitization via peripheral modulation, thereby inhibiting chronic pain without side effects in the central nervous system. Interestingly, the dual effect of BAM8-22 (i.e. inducing itch in the skin and blocking chronic pain in the spinal cord) is analogous to that of morphine (i.e. blocking pain and inducing itch). _||_Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an 'unpleasant skin sensation that elicits the desire or reflex _||_to scratch' [6]. Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) play an essential role in generating itch by detecting itch stimuli through their peripheral axons in the skin and sending signals to the spinal cord via their central axons [7]. The best characterized itch mediator is histamine, which is mainly secreted by skin mast cells and excites nearby sensory fibers by activating histamine receptors [8]. Histamine-induced itch in human skin is almost completely blocked by histamine H1 receptor antagonists. However, the blockers are ineffective in more than two-thirds of itch conditions, such as those arising from atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, renal and liver diseases, drug treatment, poisonous plants and mechanical stimuli [7]. These observations along with other electrophysiological and molecular studies indicate the existence of histamine-independent forms of itch [9-11]. Despite the clinical importance of process, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of histamine-independent itch remain largely undefined. The lack of identified cell surface receptors that directly respond to histamine independent itch stimuli is currently the major hurdle to developing novel anti-pruritus therapeutics._||_The major goal of this project is to carry out a large-scale screen of small molecular compounds for antagonists, agonists, and allosteric modulators of human MrgX1 with therapeutic implications of anti-itch and anti-chronic pain._||_Principle of the assay_||_The principle of the assay is based on that MrgX1 is potently and specifically activated by BAM8-22 (specific peptide agonist) which evokes a large rise in intracellular Ca2+. A three-addition scheme has been established for the multiplex screening of different kinds of modulators in one screen by three additions: 1) 1st addition for drug (library) itself for agonists, as well as an intrinsic counter screen to overcome common non-specificity of the calcium flux assays. 2) 2nd addition: addition of EC10 to EC30 of BAM8-22 for screen of allosteric agonist. 3) 3rd addition: addition of EC90 to ECmax of BAM8-22 for screen of antagonists/allosteric antagonists._||_Assay overview:_||_The purpose of this assay is to identify test compounds that act as an antagonist for MrgX1. This assay employs a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses MrgX1 protein. The cells, which loaded with fluorescent dye-Flou4 NW,  are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of calcium flux.. Those HEK293 cells stably expressing MrgX1 were plated into 384-well plates. On the following day, cells were incubated with Fluo4-NW solution at 37 C for 30min and at RT for 30. min after removing media. 10 uM Compounds were added to the assay buffer with dye and recorded the change of  fluorescence by Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader.  Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated fluorescence ratio. If the compound causes more than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an agonist of the MrgX1 protein._||_Keywords:_||_MrgX1, BAM 8-22, GPCR, itch, pain, chronic pain, HTS assay, counter, HEK293, 384, primary, Antagonist, allosteric, agonist, FDSS, Kinetic, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, MLSMR, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.

588692,Luciferase Reporter Cell Based HTS to identify inhibitors of N-linked Glycosylation Measured in Cell-Based System Using Plate Reader - 2146-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity_Set2,"Keywords: N-Linked Glycosylation,  luciferase reporter, reporter gene assay, luciferin, luminescence, receptor tyrosine kinases_||_Assay Overview:_||_N-linked glycosylation is a highly regulated, site-specific protein modification important for the stability and folding  of transmembrane proteins. Formation of mature carbohydrate structures requires at least twenty different enzymes and a membrane. Although N-linked glycosylation bioprocess employs up to twenty known enzymes to date, currently there is only one known inhibitor of the N-linked glycosylation process, Tunicamycin, which blocks GlcNac-1-phosphotransferase (the first step in gylcosylation)._||_One vital class of of N-glycosylated enyzmes is receptor tyrosine kinases which are often overexpressed in cancer cells.  RTKs activate proliferative and anti-apoptotic signal transduction cascades that mediate resistance to cancer therapies. Inhibition of NLG with Tunicamycin has been shown to reduce RTK expression levels and to sensitize tumor cells to radiation therapy. Tunicamycin, however,  is hepatoxic at LD50 of 2 mg/kg in mice and cannot be developed into a clinically useful agent._||_Identification of inhibitors of the NLG process would provide novel tools for glycobiology research and potential therapeutic compounds for enhancing radiation therapy in cancer patients._||_The assay uses a modified P.pyralis (luciferase) reporter gene containing three consensus NLG sites and the endoplasmic reticulum translation sequence of EGFR that has been stably integrated into the D54 cell line. Under normal cellular conditions the reporter is translated into the ER and glycosylated, inactivating the enzymatic activity of luciferase. However, under conditions where NLG is blocked, the reporter does not undergo NLG and luciferase retains enzymatic activity. The assay therefore detects inhibition of enzymatic steps that are required for efficient NLG, and the gain of function design enables robust detection of signal at potentially cytotoxic drug concentrations._||_Expected Outcome: Inhibition of the NLG pathway results in active luciferase reporter protein.  Active hits are determined as wells with luciferase signal three standard deviations above the per-plate population of neutral control wells (approximately 25% of the tunicamycin positive control.)",

The last major outbreak in 1995, reported an estimated 70,000 - 100,000 humans infected and a similar number of known horse infections.  In humans the symptoms present as fever, headache, and encephalitis.  Although the mortality rate is below 1%, the neurological disease is apparent in >/= 14% of patients.  There is no FDA approved vaccine or therapeutic and supportive care is limited.   Thus, prophylaxis and efficacious treatments are critical to minimizing the impact of the transmissible disease on human and equines. _||_The US Army has been developing vaccines for VEEV as they appreciate the impact of the disease on soldiers as well as its potential use as a bioweapon. The vaccines, which are comprised of attenuated live virus, are still in the investigational new drug (IND) stage and are only available through the Special Immunization Program at United State Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) for protecting personnel working with the virus. A few other vaccine candidates are in the IND stage, such as formalized killed TC-83 vaccine and the live attenuated V3526 vaccine. Again those vaccines have not been FDA-approved due to lack of efficacy and adverse effects seen during clinical trials. _||_The assay provider has developed and validated a 384-well cell-based assay that measures CPE induced in Vero 76 by VEEV infection, using a luminescent-based detection system for signal endpoint. The overall goal of this project is to discover novel compounds with anti-VEEV replication efficacy and minimal cytotoxicity in vitro.",

Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels._||_Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors._||_References:_||_1.

Small pharmacological compounds that bind to the cleft of the ligand-binding domain could alter receptor conformation and subsequently modify transcription of target genes. Such ligands (agonists and antagonists) have been designed for 23 nuclear receptors among the 48 identified in the human genome (1-3). NR2E3 is an orphan nuclear receptor expressed exclusively in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina (4-7). In its unliganded state, NR2E3 acts as a transcriptional repressor (4, 8, 9) due to interaction with co-repressors such as retinal RetCOR (10), NCOR (11) or SMRT (11). Defects in this gene are a cause of several retinopathies (12-15). Studies showing that mice with a spontaneous deletion in the Nr2e3 gene develop late-onset, progressive retinal degeneration (7), suggest that this nuclear receptor is essential for photoreceptor development and survival. The identification of selective NR2E3 agonists would provide useful tools for the understanding of the biological role of NR2E3 in retinal diseases._||_References:_||_1.

Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels._||_Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors._||_References:_||_1.

This differentiation causes the cells to fuse to form syncytial myotubes characteristic of muscle tissue.  It was previously shown that C2C12 myotubes treated with 10uM simvastatin show a phenotype of decreased ATP levels.  The aim is to identify molecules that are able to suppress the decrease in ATP levels in simvastatin-treated cells.  C2C12 myotubes are seeded in 384-well plates.  After an overnight incubation, growth media was changed to differentiation media containing 2% horse serum.  Following a 4-day incubation, which incudes a media change with fresh differentiation media, cells differentiated to myotubes.  Prior to compound addition, the media is changed again to fresh differentiation media containing 10uM simvastatin.  After a 48-hour incubation, CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) was added and luminescence was detected to measure changes in ATP-levels._||_Expected Outcome: Compounds that register an increase in ATP levels compared to positive (geranylgeraniol) and neutral (DMSO) controls, will be considered positives in this assay.",

602393,Screen for inhibitors of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (esBAF) in mouse embryonic stem cells with Luciferase reporter assay Measured in Cell-Based System Using Plate Reader - 2141-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity,"Keywords:_||_Mouse embryonic stem cells, ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, esBAF, Bmi1, cell-based reporter assay, inhibitor screen_||_Assay Overview:_||_Recent data indicate that the SWI/SNF-like, ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex (Brg/Brahma Associated Factors complex, referred to as BAF) is both necessary and, in certain contexts, sufficient for the induction of pluripotency. The ATPase, Brg1 or Brm, is a central component of the complex.  Mutations in these genes have been linked to human cancer. Recent genome-wide studies from a conditional Brg knockout ES cell line indicate that the esBAF complex can both activate and repress transcription and it frequently regulates promoters at a distance from its binding sites. This mode of regulation is significantly different from the regulation of SWI/SNF complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which exclusively activate genes. A major group of genes directly repressed by esBAF are members of the Polycomb repressive complex, including Bmi1, Cbx7, Ring1, Phc1, Phc2, and Suz12. We selected Bmi1 as a reporter for esBAF activity and have developed a murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) line with a firefly luciferase reporter knocked into the Bmi1 locus. Bmi1 is a particularly interesting target due to its essential role in the maintenance and self-renewal of hematopoietic and neural stem cells.  These modified mESCs were treated with compounds for 24 hours and Bmi-1 expression is measured with the Steady Glo luciferase reagnet (Promega).  The identified inhibitors from the screen will provide the precision and temporal control needed to tease out the precise functions and mechanisms of the BAF complex. These compounds will prove useful to researchers studying stem cells, chromatin remodeling, and cancer. Another important reason for selecting Bmi1 is that compounds regulating the expression of Bmi1 will be interesting independent of their effect on the BAF complex._||_Expected Outcome:_||_The esBAF complex represses the transcription of Bmi1 and firefly luciferase is knocked into the Bmi1 locus. Therefore, an inhibitor of the esBAF complex will cause an increase in signal (i.e. increase firefly luciferase activity).",20586

Murine LRH-1 was originally identified due to its sequence homology to the Drosophila Fushi tarazu factor-1 but orthologs have been subsequently identified in several other species including rat, chicken, horse, zebrafish and human (2-7). LRH-1, and its closest family member steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A1), bind to identical DNA consensus sequences (response elements or REs) and both have the ability to bind phospholipids in their ligand binding domains (LBDs) (8-10). However, LRH-1 and SF-1 are expressed in different tissues and thus are considered likely to have non-overlapping, non-redundant functions. SF-1 expression is confined to steroidogenic tissues and adrenals where it regulates development, differentiation, steroidogenesis and sexual determination (5, 7, 11). LRH-1 is highly expressed in tissues of endodermal origin and its expression is essential for normal liver, intestine, and pancreas function. LRH-1 has also been shown to be expressed in the ovary and adipose tissue._||_In a recent report, Chand and colleagues investigated the mechanism of action of LRH-1 in invasive breast cancer cells. They found that LRH-1 promotes motility and cell invasiveness in both ER-positive (MCF-7) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells and similar effects were observed in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Interestingly, both remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and E-cadherin processing were observed when LRH-1 was over-expressed. These findings implicate LRH-1 in promotion of migration and invasion in breast cancer independent of estrogen sensitivity. Together these findings provided strong evidence that LRH-1 plays a significant role in tumor formation both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the identification of potent and selective LRH-1 inverse agonists may provide new approaches for the treatment of cancer._||_References:_||_1. Fayard, E., J. Auwerx, and K.

Their functions go beyond acting as simply leak channels to set resting membrane potentials, and also involve complex regulation of physiological and pathological functions, and are subject to regulation by neurotransmitters, local pH changes, free fatty acids and lysopophospholipids, mechanical forces of the cell membrane, temperature and inhalant aesthetics. TASK1 (KCNK3), as one of the K2P family members, is a pH-dependent, voltage-insensitive, background potassium channel protein, and is in the same TASK channel family as TASK3 (KCNK9). It is widely expressed in multiple organs, with highest mRNA expression in heart, adrenal gland, placenta, adult and fetal lung, pancreatic islet, whole brain and cerebellum. Recent studies on these channels have revealed their molecular identities, voltage independent gating characteristics, and roles as mediators for a variety of important modulators, including volatile anesthetics, neurotransmitters and hormones. Recent data suggest a role for TASK channels in nocturnal activity and they have been hypothesized to contribute to obstructive sleep apneas. Different from TASK3, TASK1 is strongly expressed in the heart where it may contribute to noradrenergic regulation of cardiomyocyte electrophysiology. In addition, specific roles for TASK1 have been described in regulation of breathing by hypoxemia, ischemic neuroprotection and in an experimental autoimmune model of multiple sclerosis.  Consequently, TASK1 has been considered as a possible drug target. However, few TASK specific inhibitors are available as molecular tools for further mechanistic elucidation of TASK1 channel functions, and much less as potential therapeutic leads for the TASK1 related diseases.  Thus, the lack of specific modulators has hindered definitive identification of these channels in native tissues, which is especially critical for mechanistic studies and determining the therapeutic potential for targeting these channels.",3777

Abnormality of CaCC activity is thought to be causal or linked to several major diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and hypertension. Its roles are implicated in numerous physiological processes including cardiac and neuronal excitation, sensory transduction, trans-epithelial secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and fertilization.  Discovery of CaCC-specific chemical probes can provide not only useful tool molecules for pharmacological interrogation of the CaCC function and diversity, but may also provide compounds as starting points for therapeutic efforts to treat various diseases resulting from dysfunction in chloride transport. _||_Our objective is to find potent and specific small molecule chemical probes that modulate TMEM16A-based calcium-activated chloride channel, by performing a primary screen of the MLSMR library of 300,000 compounds to identify small molecules and structural scaffolds that modulate this calcium-activated chloride channel; and examining and identifying hits with preferential effects on TMEM16A versus other chloride channels after validation, confirmatory and counter-screens. The intended applications of the small molecule probe will be for: (a) the in vitro electrophysiological studies of CaCC functions and modulation, without the limitations of non-specific interactions with related channels; (b) dissection and delineation of the various CaCC currents in multiple tissues; (c) evaluation of potential in vivo applications for rescue of defective chloride transport in cystic fibrosis._||_Despite the discovery of the molecular identity of the CaCC channel, it is broadly recognized that there are far less CaCC/TMEM16A specific activators/potentiators available than inhibitors (10-12). Most of reported CaCC activators have been defined are non-specific potentiators, which increase the intracellular Ca2+ and consequentially indirectly affect CaCC. Only until very recently that CaCC (TMEM16A) specific activators without Ca2+ modulation have yet to be reported (13). _||_Principle of the assay_||_The iodide ion, which is permeable through the TMEM16A channel, serves as a surrogate for Cl-flux. The iodide flux is detected by YFP Iodide Biosensors (YFP mutant at H148Q/ I152L)(14). The activation of the TMEM16A by ionomycin (or ATP) triggers the channel opening and I- influx, and consequentially the quenching of the mutant YFP fluorescence. Any compounds which activate/potentiate the TMEM16A channels will result in increased quenching and lower remaining fluorescence as detected by imaging plate reader FDSS (15). _||_Assay overview:_||_The purpose of this assay is to identify test compounds that activate/potentiate the calcium-activated chloride channel (TMEM16A). This assay employs a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses TMEM16A channels. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular iodide, as monitored by a iodide-sensitive fluorescent protein YFP mutant at H148Q/ I152L. Those HEK293 cells stably expressing TMEM16A channels were plated into 384-well plates. On the following day, cells were incubated with assay buffer after removing media. Compounds were added to the assay buffer. Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and fluorescence changes measured upon the addition of trigger solution (16 mM iodide final in the well). The fluorescence of YFP was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated YFP fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound causes less than negative 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an activator/potentiator of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channels._||_Keywords:_||_CaCC, TMEM16A, ANO-1, anoctamine-1, chloride channel, calcium, calcium activated chloride channel, HTS assay, counter, CHO-K1, 384, primary, agonist, activator, potentiator, FDSS, fluorescence, Kinetic, YFP, quenching, YFP biosensor, JHICC, Johns Hopkins, MLSMR, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN._||_References:_||_1.#Schroeder, B.C., et al., Expression Cloning of TMEM16A as a Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel Subunit.

Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels._||_Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, which also has sub-micromolar activity toward M5, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. Further, in vivo active tool compounds for the M5 receptor are also unavailable. These tools will prove invaluable for verifying that novel M1 or M4 compounds do not have off target effects on M5 in vivo and assist with determining the role of M5 in the CNS._||_References:_||_1.

Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels._||_Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, which also has sub-micromolar activity toward M5, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine.

Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels._||_Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, which also has sub-micromolar activity toward M5, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. Further, in vivo active tool compounds for the M5 receptor are also unavailable. These tools will prove invaluable for verifying that novel M1 or M4 compounds do not have off target effects on M5 in vivo and assist with determining the role of M5 in the CNS._||_References:_||_1.

Serotonin mediates much of its actions by binding to and activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the surface of neurons and other cells. One of these GPCRs, the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), is a 7-transmembrane spanning GPCR in the frontal cortex which impacts on development, anxiety, depression, perception, and cognitive function [1, 2]. In neurons, the 5-HT2AR is a constitutively internalizing receptor and this trafficking is dependent upon interactions with the regulatory protein, Beta-arrestin2 [3]. Studies in cell-based assays reveal that serotonin requires Beta-arrestin2 to internalize the receptors while other agonists, such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine, internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins [3, 4]. All 5-HT2AR agonists seem to recruit Beta-arrestin2 to 5-HT2AR in cultured cells. However, while serotonin requires Beta-arrestins to traffic receptors, other agonists such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine can internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins [3, 4]. It remains to be determined if the specific 5-HT2AR-Beta-arrestin interactions and trafficking events have physiological significance. It is conceivable that the regulation of 5-HT2AR in vivo may impact neurological sensitivity to serotonin and the responsiveness to pharmacological agents and drugs of abuse. We predict that drugs that disrupt the serotonin 2A receptor-Beta-arrestin interaction might provide a means to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to the levels of serotonin present in the brain[4]. These findings may inspire the development of drugs that could be clinically useful for treating depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction [5-7]._||_References:_||_1. Hsieh, C.L., A.M.

NLRs are involved in initiating pathogenic inflammatory responses to a wide variety of pathogens as well as mediating several important diseases of chronic sterile inflammation (1-2). The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein (NOD) subfamily is characterized by proteins with a caspase-activating and recruitment domain (CARD). NOD1 and NOD2 both sense peptidoglycan, a heterogeneous polymer found in the cell walls of bacteria, but they detect distinct entities within the peptidoglycan polymer: whereas NOD2 detects muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a motif common to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan (3-4), NOD1 specifically detects diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan, which is found almost exclusively in Gram-negative bacteria (5-6). Through their N-terminal CARD domains, NOD1 and NOD2 couple peptidoglycan recognition to the NFkB pathway through a homophilic interaction with the adaptor kinase RIPK2 (7). This pathway leads to the activation of inflammatory mediators that impact on both host defense and the regulation of the immune response (8)._||_NOD2 malfunction seems to be involved in Crohn's disease and Blau's syndrome (4, 9-12). Although there are inhibitors of several of the downstream effectors of NOD2 activation, such as IL-1ss, we are not aware of any potent and specific inhibitors, and especially no small molecule inhibitors, of NOD2 activation. Such inhibitors could be very important in novel therapeutic approaches to Crohn's disease and Blau's syndrome. The high throughput assay we have designed and tested has the potential to point to such small molecule inhibitors of NOD2. Further, it has the potential to establish proof-of-concept for the idea of designing small molecule inhibitors of other CARD-CARD interactions important in a large number of other NLR related diseases (12)._||_References:_||_1.

TAAR1 (trace amine associated receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by trace amines. Trace amines (TA) such as Beta-phenethylamine (Beta-PEA), p-tyramine (TYR), octopamine, and tryptamine are endogenous amine compounds that account for less than 1% of the biogenic amines in most brain regions (5), and exert pharmacological actions in humans (6,7). In addition to binding Beta-PEA and TYR, rat TAAR1 is also activated by dopamine, octopamine, tryptamine, amphetamine, and lysergic acid (8-10). TAs are of particular interest because they have been shown to modulate the activity of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (11-13) and gamma-amino butyric acid (14-16) and alterations in their brain levels are associated with schizophrenia (17-19) and depression (20, 21). Their potential to modulate dopaminergic activity suggests that they may play a role in the efficacy of L-DOPA in treating Parkinson disease4 and addiction (13). In humans, only TAAR1 has been shown to be activated by Beta-PEA and TYR, resulting in increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation through coupling to Gs (9, 10). Endogenous hTAAR1 activity is predominantly coupled to G-alpha-s and the accumulation of cAMP. The variety of compounds potentially acting at this receptor makes it attractive to assume that hTAAR1 is involved in a variety of integrated CNS processes such as mood and cognition. As a result, hTAAR1 is an interesting target for the development of ligands to probe the role of this receptor in CNS function and disease. For this project, the assay provider has created a cell line expressing the hTAAR1 in a parent cell line (RD-HGA16 cells, Molecular Devices) that stably over expresses the promiscuous G-protein, G-alpha-16, thereby coupling hTAAR1 activation to mobilization of internal calcium stores. Because TAs may be involved in modulating a variety of behaviors including mood, cognition, and addiction, it is of interest to discover novel ligands for TAAR1 to probe the role TAs play in brain function (22, 23)._||_References:_||_1.

TAAR1 (trace amine associated receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by trace amines. Trace amines (TA) such as Beta-phenethylamine (Beta-PEA), p-tyramine (TYR), octopamine, and tryptamine are endogenous amine compounds that account for less than 1% of the biogenic amines in most brain regions (5), and exert pharmacological actions in humans (6,7). In addition to binding Beta-PEA and TYR, rat TAAR1 is also activated by dopamine, octopamine, tryptamine, amphetamine, and lysergic acid (8-10). TAs are of particular interest because they have been shown to modulate the activity of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (11-13) and gamma-amino butyric acid (14-16) and alterations in their brain levels are associated with schizophrenia (17-19) and depression (20, 21). Their potential to modulate dopaminergic activity suggests that they may play a role in the efficacy of L-DOPA in treating Parkinson disease4 and addiction (13). In humans, only TAAR1 has been shown to be activated by Beta-PEA and TYR, resulting in increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation through coupling to Gs (9, 10). Endogenous hTAAR1 activity is predominantly coupled to G-alpha-s and the accumulation of cAMP. The variety of compounds potentially acting at this receptor makes it attractive to assume that hTAAR1 is involved in a variety of integrated CNS processes such as mood and cognition. As a result, hTAAR1 is an interesting target for the development of ligands to probe the role of this receptor in CNS function and disease. For this project, the assay provider has created a cell line expressing the hTAAR1 in a parent cell line (RD-HGA16 cells, Molecular Devices) that stably over expresses the promiscuous G-protein, G-alpha-16, thereby coupling hTAAR1 activation to mobilization of internal calcium stores. Because TAs may be involved in modulating a variety of behaviors including mood, cognition, and addiction, it is of interest to discover novel ligands for TAAR1 to probe the role TAs play in brain function (22)._||_References:_||_1.

The RecBCD class of enzymes is widely distributed among bacteria (1) but is apparently not present in eukaryotes. The major pathway of double-strand DNA break repair in bacteria involves the coordinated action of nuclease and helicase activities provided by the three-subunit enzyme RecBCD, which is critical for DNA repair(2); recBCD null mutants have reduced cell viability, are hyper-sensitive to DNA damaging agents, and are deficient in homologous recombination involving linear DNA (3-5). Inhibitors of RecBCD would allow us to study the mechanism of this complex helicase-nuclease enzyme. Since this enzyme is crucial for bacterial survival during infection, we anticipate that some of these compounds will, in future work, lead to new, critically needed antibacterial drugs with few off-target effects for human use (6)._||_References:_||_1.

HIV-1 Envs expressed on the surface of cells can mediate the fusion of cells with target cells expressing the CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 receptors, such as CEM lymphoblasts. We have established an assay that monitors the cell-cell fusion activity of HIV-1 Envs with a firefly luciferase readout. In our primary high-throughput screen (HTS), a modified HeLa cell line that inducibly expresses the Envs of a primary HIV-1 strain (HIV-1JRFL) will be co-cultivated with receptor-bearing target cells (CEM21) in the presence of the compounds to be screened.  CEM21 expresses a Tet-activator responsive Luciferase reporter.  This is a Tetracycline regulated system and when the Tet-activator from the Env-expressing cell line is transferred into the target cell upon successful fusion, the Luciferase reporter will be activated.  Detection of Luciferase will occur using the SteadyGlo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI).  Maraviroc, a known CCR5 antagonist, that blocks Env-mediated cell fusion will be used as a positive control._||_Expected Outcome: Compounds that inhibit cell fusion will cause a decrease in Luciferase signal.",

The physiologic response to galanin is mediated in part by three G protein-coupled metabotropic 7-transmembrane receptor subtypes, GalR1, GalR2 and GalR3. These receptors are expressed throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems as well as the endocrine system. Both GalR1 and GalR2 are widely expressed in the CNS whereas GalR3 is the least abundantly expressed of the galanin receptor subtypes. The GalR3 in particular has been strongly implicated in addiction and mood related disorders such as anxiety and depression. It has been the target of many drug discovery programs within the pharmaceutical industry but despite the significant resources and effort devoted to discovery of galanin receptor subtype selective small molecule modulators, there have been very few reports for the discovery of such molecules and in addition, all access to primary screening data remains proprietary information. As a result the identification of novel GalR3 antagonists would serve as useful tools for understanding galanin biology and for possible investigations into the role of GalR3 in addiction and mood disorders (3-5)._||_References:_||_1.

Coactivators are required for NRs to function as transcription factors and play key roles as rheostats that determine the amplitude of biological responses to hormones(6). Consistent with the expansive biological roles that NRs play in reproduction, stress responses, energy metabolism and cell growth, disruption of coactivator biological function results in complex and pleiotropic defects. Small molecule inhibitor (SMI) screens for SRC-1 and SRC-3, which play prominent roles in cancer, have already been performed. While it also has a role in cancer, SRC-2 was found to play a critical role in energy intake by driving the dietary absorption of fat(7). SRC-2 achieves this function in response to post translational modification (PTM)-based activation by the primordial energy-sensing kinase, AMPK (among others) which phosphorylates SRC-2, increasing its intrinsic transcriptional activity. We showed that liver-specific ablation of SRC-2 results in a hypoglycemic phenotype in response to fasting(8). We further demonstrated that that hepatic SRC-2 cooperates with RORalpha to specifically drive expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), an essential rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes glucose production during fasting. SMIs capable of targeting SRC-2 could serve as novel therapeutic agents to treat obesity and other metabolic diseases._||_References:_||_1 - Onate, S.A., Tsai, S.Y., Tsai, M.J. & O'Malley, B.W.

Of interest, DAX-1 (NR0B1; nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1; dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome gene 1) is an orphan nuclear receptor shown to act as a robust transcriptional repressor, inhibiting genes involved in steroidogenesis through interaction with corepressors and regulating the pluripotency of stem cells (4-8). The human DAX-1 gene encodes a protein whose C terminus is similar to the LBD of nuclear hormone receptors, while its N terminus is composed of three cysteine-rich 70 amino acids with little similarity to known proteins (4, 7). Mutations in DAX-1 have been shown to cause the X-linked form of adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC), associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HHG). AHC-HHG-associated mutations share an altered DAX-1 C-terminal domain (5, 9), resulting in loss of transcriptional repression activity (5, 7, 9), which suggests that impairment of the DAX-1 transcriptional activity is directly linked to AHC-HHG pathogenesis. In addition, DAX-1 is highly expressed in pediatric Ewing tumors (10). As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of DAX-1 will serve as useful tools to elucidate its roles of in steroidogenesis, tumorigenesis, and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency (8)._||_References:_||_1.

Members of this family have helicase and ATPase activities and are thought to regulate transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin structure around those genes (2). The encoded protein is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SNF/SWI, which is required for transcriptional activation of genes normally repressed by chromatin. BRM is an epigenetically suppressed anti-cancer gene, which is silenced in wide variety of solid tumors (2). Because BRM function is key for growth control, restoring its expression routinely inhibits cancer cell growth. For this reason, restoring BRM has potential as an anticancer therapeutic modality (3-4). Its expression prevents cancer development as seen in murine models system where BRM loss potentiates cancer development 10-fold (5). It is known from preliminary studies that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are found to restore BRM expression in cancer cell lines, but not its function (2). However, BRM is involved in many pathways and required by numerous transcription factors which control development, differentiation, DNA repair, adhesion, and growth control (6). As such, the impact of inactivating BRM and/or restoring its expression goes well beyond growth control (7)._||_Although pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are found to restore BRM expression, but not its function in cancer cell lines, specific inhibitors of either HDAC3 or HDAC9, as well as the transcription factor GATA3 and/or MEF2D, induce a functional BRM. These other constituents involved in BRM regulation may also be the molecular targets. However, since HDAC9 and GATA3 are highly overexpressed and given the limited scope of expression of HDAC9, these proteins would be preferred targets. The fact that each are highly over-expressed is akin to EGFR in lung cancer or HER2 in breast cancer. Candidate compounds that are positive on the primary screen will be re-screened using our counter-screen, where BRM has been suppressed using anti-BRM shRNA (MG2-KDM). We have found that even the most potent inducers of BRM, are blocked by at least 50% or more by this assay. Hence, false positives will yield readouts of luciferase activity that show >50% inductions, closely approximating the levels found in the primary BRM (MG213) screen and will not have inductions <50% as observed with essentially all BRM-specific inducers._||_Compounds will be then be verified as positive hits by a series of assays beginning with a third confirmatory (dose response) screening. Following the dose response screening, hits will be screened by directly measuring BRM induction by qPCR since the BRM gene is controlled by transcription. Additionally, we will determine the relative specificity the hits identified by screening each for its potential to induce a number (~10) of BRM-dependent genes. Since each of these BRM-dependent genes are controlled by different signal transduction pathways, interference in one or more cellular pathways (due to lack of specificity for BRM) will be demonstrated by a lack or reduced induction of one or more of the BRM-dependent genes. Moreover, the level of induction observed for each BRM-dependent gene is an indirect marker for the potency of BRM induction._||_A secondary goal of this project is to group these verified compounds based upon their relative site of action in the pathway of BRM induction. We will use a secondary assay to differentiate compounds affecting upstream and downstream sections in the regulatory pathway. A possible additional screen will then be optionally performed using cells harboring anti-HDAC2 shRNA (MGH2KD cells). Since the deacetylation of BRM is a requirement for function thus generating a luciferase signal in these reporter cells, only the compound(s) that affect higher-level regulatory genes (such as MAP kinase inhibition) will be identified with a positive result using this assay. For those compounds having an impact lower in the pathway, we will use them to determine if they inhibit BRN2, GATA3, HDAC3, MEF2D, or perhaps HDAC9, thereby assisting us in determining which motifs of the compound underlie the re-expression of BRM. After this series of screens, all hits will then undergo a series of secondary assays to determine how well they restore BRM expression and its function in BRM-deficient cell lines. The assay provider will explore these secondary MOA studies in additional collaboration beyond the scope of this CPDP._||_References:_||_1. Bourachot, B., M. Yaniv, and C.

The developmental stages of these organisms are widely studied (3, 4). One stage, dauer (German for 'duration,' also known as an alternative L3 larval stage) covers an alternative larval stage in which development stops and the worms enter a hibernation-like state in which they can survive extremely harsh environmental conditions, often for years.

As the burden of parasitic nematodes grows in the face of emerging resistance to the few existing antihelminthic agents, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the life cycles of parasitic worms so that new drugs may be developed (1). The nuclear receptor DAF-12 (for 'dauer formation'), first identified in C. elegans, is known to control many nematode species' entry into and exit from the dauer resting state (6). Daf-12 belongs to a family of over 30 genes which transduce environmental signals to influence the choice between dauer or reproductive development. Favorable environments activate insulin/IGF and TGF-beta pathways converge, leading to production of the steroid hormone dafachronic acid (DA), which binds and activates Daf-12 (7). Currently available antihelminthic agents, to which resistance is beginning to emerge, act primarily on the feeding stages of the worms and have little effect on the infectious stages (8). Therefore, pharmacologic activators developed through high-throughput screening would be used both practically as nematicides and academically as tools to characterize the role of DAF-12 in modulating life cycle (8, 9)._||_References:_||_1.

COUP-TFII has widespread tissue distribution in human; detectable expression has been found in every tissue type examined (12). Currently, the treatment for tumor angiogenesis focuses mainly on blocking VEGFR-2 signaling and has not been effective due to limited efficacy, eventually leading to resistance and/or relapse. COUP-TFII has been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis through modulating multiple angiogenic signals (VEGF/VEGFR-2, Angiopoietin 1/Tie2 and E2F-1) in many different types of cancer (13-14). In addition, COUP-TFII is overexpressed in prostate and several other cancers and is an excellent prognostic marker. By including COUP-TFII data with Cyclin D1, p21, PTEN, and Smad4 data in the prognosis, the prognostic accuracy is improved. The expression level of COUP-TFII and its role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis in prostate cancer has been examined, and these data indicate that COUP-TFII positively promotes prostate tumor growth and metastasis (15). These results provide the rational basis to posit that inhibition of COUP-TFII may offer a novel and broadly efficacious approach for anticancer intervention._||_COUP-TFII has also been shown to regulate energy storage and expenditure. We have found that COUP-TFII heterozygous mice have increased mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipose tissue, which results in higher energy expenditure, resulting in resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity and improved glucose homeostasis due to increased insulin sensitivity at peripheral tissues (16). These results indicate that COUP-TFII has an important role in regulating adipocyte differentiation and energy metabolism. Therefore, COUP-TFII inhibitors could potentially serve as agents to improve insulin sensitivity, enhance energy metabolism, and decrease high fat diet-induced obesity._||_References:_||_1.

Immune evasion in human SCC primarily results from aberrant T cell homing. Vessels in SCC lack expression of the critical cutaneous T cell homing E-selectin and exclude the population of antigen-experienced skin homing T cells most capable of recognizing the tumor. There is therefore a need to identify novel agents that can induce endothelial activation and restore appropriate T cell homing without broad, nonspecific activation of the immune system. This project plan describes a high-throughput screening assay to identify small molecules that induce E-selectin expression on human endothelial cells.  3,000 human umbilical epithelial vein cells (HUVEC) are added to gelatin-coated imaging plates.  Compounds or TNF-alpha (positive control) are added 24 hours before cells are stained for E-selectin and nuclear dyes.  Cells are imaged with a 4x microIX system and the data is analyzed using MetaX software to identify the number of E-selectin positive cells.  Compounds increasing the percent of E-selectin positive cells beyond 3 times the standard deviation of the neutral controls and are not greater than 20% toxic to the cells will be considered 'actives'._||_Expected Outcome: Compounds that singnificantly cause an increase in E-Selectin expression and therefore have an increased number of E-selectin positive cells (gain of signal) will be considered active compounds.  Compounds causing greater than 20% decrease in cell number will be excluded from the study.",6401

The developmental stages of these organisms are widely studied [3, 4]. One stage, dauer (German for 'duration', also known as an alternative L3 larval stage) covers an alternative larval stage in which development stops and the worms enter a hibernation-like state in which they can survive extremely harsh environmental conditions, often for years. In the case of parasitic nematodes, this resting state is quite often the infectious state [5]. As the burden of parasitic nematodes grows in the face of emerging resistance to the few existing antihelminthic agents, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the life cycles of parasitic worms so that new drugs may be developed [1]. The nuclear receptor DAF-12 (for 'dauer formation'), first identified in C. elegans, is known to control many nematode species' entry into and exit from the dauer resting state [6]. Daf-12 belongs to a family of over 30 genes which transduce environmental signals to influence the choice between dauer or reproductive development. Favorable environments activate insulin/IGF and TGF-beta pathways converge, leading to production of the steroid hormone dafachronic acid (DA), which binds and activates Daf-12 [7]. Currently available antihelminthic agents, to which resistance is beginning to emerge, act primarily on the feeding stages of the worms and have little effect on the infectious stages [8]. Therefore, pharmacologic activators developed through high-throughput screening would be used both practically as nematicides and academically as tools to characterize the role of DAF-12 in modulating life cycle [8, 9]._||_References:_||_1.

About 90% of people with CF have at least one copy of the 'F508del' mutation (deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, or CFTR-F508del), and over 70% of CF patients are homozygous for this mutation. CFTR-F508del proteins are improperly folded, defective in trafficking to the plasma membrane, which results in the impairment of the channel functions. The mutated channel is still functional but is not present at the cell surface to achieve its normal functions. This assay aims to evaluate the correcting activity of small molecules on the function of CFTR-F508del. The correcting activity is determined by examining the fluorescence quenching ability of  human bronchial epithelial CFBE cells expressing CFTR-F508del as well as a halide-sensitive Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP). Compound(s) restoring CFTR-F508del function will allow additional mutated CFTR channels to be expressed at the cell surface resulting in an enhanced fluorescent quenching ability of these CFBE cells._||_Expected outcome: Identify small molecules decreasing the fluorescence mediated by a halide-sensitive YFP present in CFBE cells expressing a mutated form of the human CFTR protein (F508del) by the quencher sodium iodide.

In humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is either sporadic, affecting mainly people over 60 years, iatrogenic, or genetic with a high penetrance. Prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation, in brain and lymphoid tissue of PrPsc [2], a misfolded, aggregated form of the host prion protein PrP [3, 4]. PrPsc is thought to be the main or only constituent of the prion, the infectious agent [5-8]. PrP is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein of 254 amino acids attached to the cell surface in microdomains known as lipid rafts [9-11], and tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly flexible region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler disease._||_Prion replication is based on the structural conversion of the host prion protein into its harmful misfolded counterpart. In the sporadic form of CJD, the initial misfolding of PrP may be a rare, stochastic event. In familial CJD, this event is triggered by certain mutations in the protein. When the disease is transmitted, PrPsc acts as a template and 'seeds' the misfolding of the host PrP. Prion diseases are not curable and the survival time is typically 6 to 12 months after the onset of symptoms. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, is transmissible to humans [12, 13]. While about 200 individuals are known to have succumbed to 'human BSE' (variant CJD), the number of infected but as yet asymptomatic people is unknown because there is no preclinical diagnostic test for prion diseases and the incubation time may extend to decades; this is of particular concern because the disease is transmissible by blood transfusion. As a result, the identification of compounds that suppress cell surface PrP and thereby suppress prion replication may provide useful tools for the therapy of prion diseases, and for study of PrP biosynthetic and cellular trafficking pathways.

Recent renewed emphasis on the eradication of malaria has highlighted the need for more tools to achieve this ambitious goal. Major progress has been made where insecticide-impregnated bed nets (ITN) and artemesinin-based combination therapy (ACT) have been deployed [3]. While at least one vaccine is entering phase III trials, many obstacles remain before a vaccine is available for widespread deployment [4], meaning that vector control and case management by chemotherapy remain the primary means of control. Once these tools reduce the infection prevalence to low levels, additional efforts will be required to interrupt transmission. This was highlighted in a recent report by the malERA Consultative Group on Drugs [5]. In this report the authors stated that #The dream of a safe, long-acting drug that eliminates malaria infection by killing liver stages and that blocks transmission by killing gametocytes remains both unfulfilled and a top priority#. Gametocytes, the sexual form of the malaria parasite in human, are essential for transmission from one human host to another via a mosquito carrier. Late-stage gametocytes are refractory to treatment by all the classes of anti-malarial agents. In addition, due to the relatively inert metabolism of late-stage gametocytes, even clinically effective antimalarial treatment of the host may not lead to prevention of transmission. Thus there is an urgent need for the identification of novel agents that can remove viable late-stage gametocytes from the patient#s circulation, and thus prevent transmission of the parasite to the mosquito vector. Although a number of antimalarial drug therapies are active in vitro against early stage gametocytes, there are few truly effective late stage gametocyte inhibitors._||_References:_||_1.

However, going from SNP association to a high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify novel drugs requires many steps and has not yet been successfully accomplished.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a strong genetic basis.  More than 60 risk loci have been identified, which point to the importance of discrete biological pathways as important in RA pathogenesis.  One important pathway is CD40 signaling, as determined by an association at CD40 itself, genetic associations at other genes in the CD40 signaling pathway, and biological studies in mouse and man. CD40 is a cell surface receptor molecule expressed on B cells.  Engagement of CD40 by its membrane-bound ligand, CD40L, activates the canonical NF-kB pathway to regulate a spectrum of molecular and cellular processes. Prior efforts to inhibit the CD40-CD40L binding via monoclonal antibodies targeting CD40L showed therapeutic effectiveness in mouse and man.  However, anti-CD40L monoclonal antibodies led to unacceptable thrombotic events, because CD40L is expressed on platelets.  We hypothesize that inhibitors specific to CD40-mediated intracellular signaling in B-cells will lead to clinical efficacy with minimal toxicity._||_We have published preliminary data demonstrating that the CD40 RA risk allele is associated with higher levels of CD40 on the surface of cells.  We recapitulated the biology of the RA risk allele in a human B-cell line (BL2), demonstrating that higher levels of CD40 lead to increase NF-kB activation. We generated BL2 cells with a stable NFkB-driven luciferase reporter construct (BL2-NFkB-luc). We developed a high-throughput luciferase assay suitable for HTS: we active BL2-NFkB-luc cells with trimerized CD40 ligand (tCD40L) and measure luciferase activity. Using a positive control inhibitor (IKK inhibitor VII), we demonstrated good assay performance (Z'-factor approximately 0.80).  A pilot study in collaboration with the Broad Institute Probe Development Center (BIPDeC) screened ~2,000 compounds.  After counter screens in additional cell lines activated with TNFa and LPS, we identified 2 novel compounds that inhibit CD40-mediated activation of primary human B cells._||_Expected Outcome:_||_Selective Inhibitors of CD40 signaling will reduce the Luciferase reporter signal induced by CD40 ligand in the BL2 NF-kB reporter cell line while not effeecting the TNFa induced signal in these same cells.",

It has been shown that genetic over-expression of wild type human TTR in the well-studied validated APP23 transgenic model of human AD suppresses the neuropathologic and behavioral AD phenotypes [4]. Silencing the endogenous TTR gene accelerates the pathologic changes [4-5]. A number of studies have shown that TTR and Amyloid-B interact [4, 6-8], and that TTR inhibits Amyloid-B-induced cytotoxicity, Amyloid-B fibril formation and Amyloid-B oligomerization [9]. Since neurons appear to use TTR as a protective molecule, enhancing neuronal production of TTR might be a useful strategy for either treatment or prophylaxis of AD. The overall goal of this project is to identify well characterized or novel compounds which can be used as pharmacologic agents to enhance neuronal transcription of the TTR gene (and subsequent TTR protein production) to determine if the same salutary pharmacological effect can be achieved is was possible genetically in a well-validated model of human Amyloid-B deposition._||_References:_||_1.

1159614,A Novel Cell-Based Assay to Identify Small Molecules for B -Galactocerebrosidase,"Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused by genetic mutations in genes encoding proteins important for normal lysosomal function. Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), mostly known as Krabbe disease, is a prototype of the neurological LSDs caused by deficiency of beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). In brain specimens of GLD patients, psychosine levels are substantially elevated. At elevated concentrations, psychosine becomes cytotoxic to neuronal cells, particularly to oligodendrocytes (OLG), neural cells responsible for myelin formation. Therefore, the biochemical disturbances in GLD are manifested by different degrees of brain demyelination resulting in a broad spectrum of neurological manifestations. Most of the FDA-approved therapies are based on enzyme replacement therapeutic (ERT) agents, which treat non-neurological symptoms of Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, few mucopolysaccharidoses and Pompe disease. Unfortunately, in GLD, a primarily neurological LSD, ERT agents, as large molecular weight molecules unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, which makes this an inefficacious therapeutic approach. In GLD, increasing the residual GALC activity just above the critical threshold (~10% of wild type enzymatic activity), the cytotoxic levels of psychosine will be reduced, avoiding the OLGs apoptosis and the subsequent demyelination process. This will translate in disease stabilization and amelioration of GLD patient symptoms. _||_A cell-based assay in 1,536-well plate format was developed to implement a quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) assay using GLD-disease relevant cells to identify small molecules that produce enhancements of the residual enzymatic activity levels of mutants GALC found and prevalent in GLD patients. Compounds that are active may therefore have some therapeutic application for GLD. After the treatment of live cells for a determined period, using a fluorescent GALC specific substrate, the mutant residual GALC activity is measured. This cell-based qTHS assay was used to screen part of the MLPCN library for small molecule able to increase the mutant GALC enzymatic activity. In this assay, increased fluorescent signal corresponds to enhanced levels of mutant GALC residual enzymatic activity. Activation is the desired outcome for this assay._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: MH098689_||_Assay Submitter (PI): Gustavo Maegawa MD,PhD, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL",2581

The distal effector of the pathway - YAP, functions as a transcriptional activator driving expression of pro-proliferation and anti- apoptotic genes (3). Importantly, several tumor types are YAP dependent, including colorectal, hepatocellular, meningioma, mesothelioma and schwannoma. Several studies strongly promote the notion that inhibiting the Hippo-YP pathway will show efficacy in a broad spectrum of cancer types (3,4). Our long-term goal is to identify small molecule inhibitors of the Hippo-Yap pathway that can be developed into therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers that are Hippo- YAP dependent. To obtain potent lead compounds that selectively inhibit YAP-driven transcription we implemented an ultra High Throughput Screening campaign using the Scripps Drug Discovery Library. Identified leads were assessed in a series of secondary screens and Structure Activity Relationship analysis and medicinal chemistry was used to optimize and prioritize leads based on their drug-like properties. Top leads will be used in mechanism of action studies and tested in cell-based models of YAP-dependent tumors including meningioma and schwannoma cells to determine the effects of select compounds on tumor cell growth and survival. The proposed research campaign will identify safe and potent lead compounds that will be tested in vivo and leads suitable for clinical development as therapeutics will be identified. These studies should result in identification of select leads demonstrating efficacy against a broad spectrum of human tumors which are YAP-dependent involvement._||_References:_||_1.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), a homolog of gp91phox. Nox1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that Nox1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing Nox1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that Nox1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of Nox1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

2240,Luminescence Cell-Based Primary HTS to Identify Inhibitors of MITF,"This data was generated through collaboration with the National Cancer Institute's Initiative for Chemical Genetics_||_Internal Project ID: 2007_||_Keywords: MITF, Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, TRPM1 gene, melanocyte proliferation_||_Assay:  To identify broad suppressors of MITF activity - either by suppression of MITF expression or by inhibition of MITF activity (without affecting expression)._||_Expected Outcome: Active wells will show a reduced luminescence intensity due to fewer viable cells._||_Overview: Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) acts as a master regulator of melanocyte development, function and survival by modulating various differentiation and cell-cycle progression genes. It has been demonstrated that MITF is an amplified oncogene in a fraction of human melanomas and that it also has an oncogenic role in human clear cell sarcoma. Understanding the molecular function of MITF and its associated pathways will hopefully shed light on strategies for improving therapeutic approaches for these diseases. The MITF promoter is regulated by multiple factors, which have independently been shown to play key roles in human pigmentation. These include the Wnt pathway, SOX10, and PAX3. Mutations within MITF, SOX10, and PAX3 occur in patients with Waardenburg Syndrome, with the MITF mutations arising in patients exhibiting the pure melanocytic phenotype, whereas SOX10 or PAX3 mutations cause melanocyte defects plus additional abnormalities. Post-translational regulation of MITF occurs via phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or sumoylation of MITF. The functional consequences of these modifications are partially understood at this time, though additional details remain to be understood. Collectively the multiple levels of control of MITF expression and activity represent potential opportunities for small molecule modulation of the development of malignant melanoma. The main goal of this proposal is to engineer a screen which will very broadly suppress MITF activity-either by suppression of MITF expression or by inhibition of MITF activity (without affecting expression)._||_  To achieve this goal, we will utilize a luciferase reporter containing the promoter of a strong direct transcriptional target of MITF--  the TRPM1 gene, stabaly expressed in a human melanocyte cell line.  We have previously identified the TRPM1 gene (also called Melastatin) as a direct target of MITF, which contains numerous MITF binding sites, and which directly responds in potent fashion to MITF overexpression. TRPM1's expression also correlates closely to MITF's within human melanoma cell lines, as well as in clinical pigmented lesions (nevi and melanomas). In addition, we will perform a screen with the wild type melanocyte cell line using cell viability as a read out. _||_The Specific Aims of this proposal are the following:_||_  1. To identify small molecule suppressors of MITF activity and melanocyte proliferation through a cell based transcriptional assay (based on the TRPM1 promoter) using HTS approach._||_  2. To validate and characterize the identified positive small molecule hits in vitro and in vivo._||_Reduction of MITF activity sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting MITF in combination with BRAF or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors may offer a rational therapeutic avenue into melanoma, a highly chemotherapy-resistant neoplasm.",4286
2241,Luminescence Cell-Based Primary HTS to Identify Inhibitors of A1,"This data was generated through collaboration with the National Cancer Institute's Initiative for Chemical Genetics._||_Keywords: _||_apoptosis, BH3 domain, Bcl2-A1, BIM, caspase, cancer_||_Primary Collaborators:_||_Todd Golub, Broad Institute, golub@broadinstitute.org_||_Project Overview:_||_The bcl family protein A1 is an anti-apoptotic factor that works in a manner similar to other proteins such as Bcl2 and BclXL, binding to and inhibiting pro-apoptotic factors such as BIM and tBid.  Many cancers are dependent on overexpression of anti-apoptotic factors and are addicted to high levels of these proteins.  Inhibition of these anti-apoptotic proteins can selectively induce apoptosis of these cancer cells.  Compounds in the clinic such as ABT-263 work through a similar mechanism, binding to Bcl2 and releasing the corresponding pro-apoptotic protein.  The goal of the project is to identify compounds that induce apoptosis in A1-dependent cells and do not affect cells not addicted to overexpression of A1._||_Assay Overview:_||_The fate of cell survival versus apoptosis is determined by the balance of anti and pro-apoptotic proteins. _||_Expression of activator BH3-only proteins, such as BIM or tBID, leads to downstream caspase activation and apoptosis. A1 can functionally bind to and sequester BIM or tBID. In this assay, the parental control cells do not depend on A1 for survival. However, they can be primed to depend on A1 by co-expressing A1 and BIM. The primed cells still maintain a balance between anti and pro-apoptotic proteins, but rely on A1 to sequester BIM.  An A1 inhibitor causes the release of A1-bound BIM, which activates BAX/BAK, and leads to caspase activation that can be quantitatively measured using a luciferin-linked caspase substrate (peptide sequence DEVD) available commercially as Promega's Caspase Glo 3/7 reagent._||_Expected Outcome:  Compounds that cause caspase activation will show an increase in luminescence signal as measured by the caspase glo reagent.  Additional assays will determine whether this caspase activation is being caused by general toxicity or off target effects (as is the case for the nonspecific positive control, clofoctol) or due to the on-target disruption of the A1-BIM interaction (as is the case for the specific but weaker positive control, Bcl-263, which mimics the BH3 homology domain of BIM.)",
2275,Luminescence Cell-Based Primary HTS to Measure Viability of BJeLR cells,"This data was generated through collaboration with the National Cancer Institute's Initiative for Chemical Genetics_||_Internal Project ID: 2013_||_Keywords: Ras, apoptosis, cancer, VDAC, oxidative cell death_||_Assay: Cell viability of BJeLR (BJ fibroblasts transformed with hTERT, genomic SV40 LT and ST oncoproteins, and oncogenic HRASV12).  Using CellTiterGlo, which measures the amount of intracellular ATP from living cells, the total amount of viable cells can be measured by luminescence readout.  Cells are treated with compounds for 48 hours to allow detection of compounds that may be slower-acting._||_Expected Outcome: Compounds that are toxic to these transformed fibroblasts, either selectively due to the HRAS oncogene or due to nonspecific toxicity, will cause a loss of luminescence signal due to fewer live cells.  Specificity will be determined in future counterscreens._||_Overview: The first rat sarcoma (RAS) oncogene was discovered as a genetic element from the Harvey and Kirsten rat sarcoma viruses with the ability to immortalize mammalian cells1-3. Mutated RAS oncogenes (i.e. HRAS, NRAS and KRAS) are found in 10-20% of all human cancers: KRAS mutations are found in >90% of pancreatic cancers, 50% of colon cancers and 25% of lung adenocarcinomas; NRAS mutations are found in 30% of liver cancers and 15% of melanomas, and HRAS mutations are found in 10% of kidney and bladder cancers4._||_RAS proteins are guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins with GTPase activity and are associated with the plasma membrane. In the GTP-bound form, RAS proteins are mitogenic. Mutation of glycine-12 to other amino acids (including valine, i.e. RASG12V) results in an oncogenic allele with constitutive mitogenic, transforming activity and reduced GTPase activity5. Four downstream pathways activated by RAS proteins are (i) the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which regulates cell-cycle progression, (ii) the PI3K/PDK/AKT pathway, which regulates cell survival, (iii) the RalGDS pathway, which regulates membrane trafficking and vesicle formation, and (iv) the PLCε/PKC pathway, which regulates Ca++ signaling._||_We are searching for compounds and mechanisms that cause oncogene-selective lethality. Such compounds eliminate tumor cells harboring specific oncogenic mutations, but have minimal effects on normal_||_cells lacking these mutations. In this project, we propose to screen for new compounds that are selectively lethal to tumor cells expressing the RAS oncogenes. It is important to note that these compounds do not directly inhibit RAS proteins or the RAS pathway, but rather cause cell death specifically in tumor cells containing oncogenic RAS proteins.",
2313,Luminescence Cell-Based Primary HTS to Identify Inhibitors of the Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Pathway,"This data was generated through collaboration with the National Cancer Institute's Initiative for Chemical Genetics_||_Internal Project ID: 2018_||_Keywords: Sonic Hedgehog Signaling, Inhibition, Reporter Assay_||_Assay: The Hh pathway involves the binding of one of the Hh ligands to its 7-pass trans-membrane receptor, Patched (Ptc, Ptch-1 in mammals), which then releases its inhibitory effect on the pseudo-G-coupled protein receptor Smoothened (Smo). This leads to the liberation of the transcription factor Gli from an inhibitory complex in the cytosol, which can then subsequently travel to the nucleus and begin regulating the transcription of target genes including Gli and Ptc._||_In these studies, the LIGHT 2 cell line was used. This recombinant cell line bears a stably incorporated Gli-dependent firefly luciferase reporter as well as a constitutively active Renilla luciferase reporter for normalization. The Shh LIGHT 2 cell line is quite responsive to Shh, and produces a robust and dynamic firefly luciferase readout in response to pathway activation. In the presence of the broadly characterized Shh inhibitor, cyclopamine, the induced firefly luciferase activity is reduced to basal levels. The Shh LIGHT 2 cell line is also sensitive to agonists, as illustrated by the multi-fold induction of firefly luciferase activity in the presence of SAG, a Shh pathway agonist.  These findings demonstrates that the Shh LIGHT 2 cell line can serve as a sensitive model for Shh pathway agonists and antagonists for these studies._||_Expected Outcome:  Hit compounds will be those which show reduced luciferase activity without loss of viability fluorescent signal.",

Our screen will be aimed at identifying compounds that can reverse PD-1-mediated inhibition of T cell activation.  To recapitulate PD-1 signaling in vitro, we have established a bead-based system that uses the native ligand for PD-1, PDL-1, to trigger PD-1 stimulation and block TCR-mediated proliferation of T cells.  Compounds that abrogate PD-1-mediated signaling will therefore cause increased proliferation, detected via Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI).  Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used as positive control.  We screened approximately twenty nine thousand compounds in duplicate.  Data was normalized using values from PMA and vehicle control (see HTS Data Analysis section).  A single compound reproducibly showed above 50% activation._||_Expected Outcome:_||_Increase of signal by active compounds",

This cell line is KRAS dependent and the serine/threonine kinase 33 (STK33) was identified as being synthetically lethal using an RNAi screen.  Many non-transformed cells do not die when STK33 is knocked out; many transformed lines, however, become STK33 dependent.  This screen looks at the viability of the AML line NOMO-1 exposed to compounds over a multi-day incubation.  Viability is determined using the Cell Titer Glo reagent which gives a luminescent signal proportional to the number of viable cells.  To discern compounds that are specific, a counter screen using THP-1 will be used._||_Expected Outcome: An inhibitor of STK33 should cause lower viability in the NOMO-1 cells.  Lower viability will be detected by a lower signal in the CellTitreGlo Assay.  Toxic compounds which do not have any affect on STK33 will need to be eliminated through counter screening.",65975

The cellular and temporal context of these events is critical. For example, signaling through NOTCH receptors is essential for cell fate determination, progenitor cell proliferation, and adjacent cell-cell communication during development as well as in mature cells (3), and is essential for determining T-cell versus B-cell lineage commitment (4). The NOTCH proteins are Type 1 single-pass transmembrane receptors that regulate cell fate decisions in the embryo (3). These proteins are evolutionarily conserved from insects to humans (5), and it has been shown that hematopoetic progenitors differentiate into T lymphocytes upon exposure to NOTCH ligands and cytokines. Studies demonstrating a role for NOTCH in autoimmune disease (6), vascular development (7), stroke (8), Alzheimer's disease (9), and pancreatic regeneration (10) suggest that NOTCH has numerous roles in the adult and embryo. The identification of selective NOTCH agonists may elucidate the specific roles of NOTCH in these events, and serve as tools for basic research in immunology, development and cancer._||_References:_||_1.

The recent trend of increased epidemic dengue activity and increased incidence of DHF around the world is unprecedented. In the Americas as of December 14, there were 893,453 reported cases, including 23,980 DHF cases and 370 deaths in 2009 (32, 33). There is a small risk for dengue outbreaks in the continental United States, and most dengue cases in the US Continental are travel-associated, however, DF cases were reported in Key West in July, 2009, which represents the 1st documented presence of dengue in Florida in more than 40 years (8). Dengue also occurs as endemic transmission among residents in the US territories (1). In 2009, a total of 5,788 suspected dengue cases, including 54 DHF cases and 2 deaths, were reported in Puerto Rico (33).  With the rapid expansion of dengue disease in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world and the threats in Continental US, it is urgent to develop effective prevention and control measures, including antivirals and vaccines, for dengue disease. In the past few decades, dengue vaccines, including live-attenuated live tetravalent vaccines, have been developed, and several vaccine candidates have completed phase two trials, however, no FDA licensed dengue vaccine is currently available. Many factors contribute to the elusiveness of dengue vaccine, including the complexity of the dengue disease, such as 'the antibody-dependent enhancement', the possible recombination between a vaccine strain and wild type virus, and a lack of the proper animal disease models for pathogenesis studies (13, 25). Recently, more attention has been paid to antiviral drug discovery against dengue disease. Several assays and strategies have been developed to identify potential antivirals, including virtual screening, screening of small-molecule compounds libraries using replicon-based assay, and antisense RNA strategies (22, 23, 36). A number of compounds have shown their efficacy in inhibiting DENV replication in vitro, including ribavirin, mycophenolic acid (MPA), 7-deaza-2'-Cmethyl-adenosine, and 6-O-butanoyl castanospermine (1, 5, 7, 24, 29-31, 34). Nevertheless, there are still no antiviral drugs being tested against dengue disease in any clinical trials._||_With the rapid expansion of dengue disease in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world, it is urgent to develop antiviral drugs against dengue infection. Unfortunately, there are no efficient vaccines and no effective antiviral drugs available against DENV. Currently, vector control remains as the major prevention measure. Antiviral drug discovery requires the development of reliable, robust and HTS amenable biological assay(s), which is not available for DENV currently.",
588778,A High Throughput Screening Assay for Inhibitors of Bacterial Motility in Vibrio cholerae,"Cholera is an acute water-borne diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae of serogroups O1 and O139.  Vibrio cholerae is a pathogen that has historically caused human disease and epidemics and continues to cause outbreaks in endemic areas. It still has the potential to cause outbreaks where ever sanitation is poor and clean drinking water is unavailable.   The advent of modern waste water treatment and drinking water purification has virtually eliminated cholera from developed countries, but any disruption to modern water treatment can result in outbreaks of cholera.  Recent outbreaks have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa due to political unrest and in Haiti following the earthquake.  Both resulted in cholera outbreaks due to a breakdown in sanitation and water purification infrastructure.  Cholera outbreaks continue to be a major public health problem in endemic areas of South Asia and Africa where cholera is estimated to cause 5 million cases and more than 100,000 deaths per year.  Antibiotics are frequently used to treat cholera to mitigate the duration and severity of its life-threatening clinical symptoms in the most severe cases. This has produced antibiotic resistant strains V. cholerae O1 and O139 which can complicate treatment and limit treatment options. The development of drugs that target virulence factors could provide novel prophylactic measures and/or adjunctive therapies to limit outbreaks and circumvent antibiotic resistance.   To this end, a high throughput screen was developed to screen for bacterial motility, a virulence factor which is required for colonization of the gut and establishment of infection.  This was accomplished by adapting the standard soft agar motility assay, normally done in low density plates (PMID:17644774 Malapaka, R. R., A. A. Barrese III, and B. C. Tripp. 2007) or petri dishes, to 384-well format.  An 8000 compound library was screened using this methodology to establish feasibility for an HTS campaign.

Mutation might also increase resistance to chemotherapy. These observations and the finding that mutant p53 is often expressed at high levels, make mutant p53 an important target for cancer therapy. Several strategies for restoration of wt-p53 function in tumors containing mutant p53 have been designed, however the resulting molecules are targeting less frequently occurring mutations and exhibit limited efficacy. Therefore we propose here to identify small molecules specifically targeting the hotspot codon 273, which is among the most frequently occurring events in cancers with p53 mutations. To achieve this task, a cell-based primary screen using SW480 stably expressing PUMA P53 promoter linked to luciferase gene will be performed.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

2465,Luminescence Cell-Based Primary HTS to Identify Compounds which Inhibit A1 Apoptosis,"This data was generated through collaboration with the National Cancer Institute's Initiative for Chemical Genetics._||_Keywords: apoptosis, BH3 domain, Bcl2-A1, BIM, caspase, cancer_||_ _||_Primary Collaborator: Todd Golub, Broad Institute, golub@broadinstitute.org_||_ _||_Assay Overview: _||_The fate of cell survival versus apoptosis is determined by the balance of anti and pro-apoptotic proteins. Expression of activator BH3-only proteins, such as BIM or tBID, leads to downstream caspase activation and apoptosis. A1 can functionally bind to and sequester BIM or tBID. In this assay, the parental control cells do not depend on A1 for survival. However, they can be primed to depend on A1 by co-expressing A1 and BIM. The primed cells still maintain a balance between anti and pro-apoptotic proteins, but rely on A1 to sequester BIM._||_An A1 inhibitor causes the release of A1-bound BIM, which activates BAX/BAK, and leads to caspase activation that can be quantitatively measured using a luciferin-linked caspase substrate (peptide sequence DEVD) available commercially as Promega's Caspase Glo 3/7 reagent._||_ _||_Expected Outcome:  Compounds that cause caspase activation will show an increase in luminescence signal as measured by the caspase glo reagent.  Additional assays will determine whether this caspase activation is being caused by general toxicity or off target effects (as is the case for the nonspecific positive control, clofoctol) or due to the on-target disruption of the A1-BIM interaction (as is the case for the specific but weaker positive control, ABT-263, which mimics the BH3 homology domain of BIM.)",10018
488910,Detect Cellular ATP-levels in INS-1E Cells Measured in Cell-Based System Using Plate Reader - 2061-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity,"_||_Keywords: cytokine-induced apoptosis, pancreatic beta cells, INS1E insulinoma cells, Type I diabetes_||_Assay Overview:  INS1E rat insulinoma cells are similar to pancreatic beta cells because they secrete insulin in response to glucose stimulation.  In the dose titration version of the primary assay, INS1E cells are treated with 3 cytokines (Interferon-gamma, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and Interleukin 1-beta) and compounds for 48 hours. The combination of cytokines leads to apoptotic cell death.  The level of cell death is inferred my measuring overall ATP levels with Promega's Cell Titer Glo.  On day 0, cells were plated at 8000 per well in 30 uL phenol red free RPMI..  On day 1, cytokines were added in 10 uL of phenol red free RPMI media and compounds were added immediately afterwards.  Cells were incubated for 48 hours with cytokines and compounds.  On day 3, 20 uL of Cell Titer Glo was added per well and ATP levels were measured with the Perkin Elmer Envision plate reader with settings for standard luminescence.",
651903,Intracellular Trypanosomes Measured in Cell-Based/Microorganism System Using Plate Reader - 2017-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity_Set2,"Keywords: Trypanosoma cruzi, Chagas disease_||_Assay Overview: The assay detects intracellular trypanosomes that are replicating inside host cells.  NIH3T3 cells are trypsinized, counted, and plated in 384-well tissue culture plates.  After plating the NIH3T3 cells, compounds are added to the wells.  T. cruzi that are genetically modified to express b-galactosidase are then harvested and active Trypomastigotes form  are counted and co-cultured with the NIH3T3 cells.  After 90 hours of co-culture, all cells in the well are lysed and b-galactosidase production is detected using a luminescent reporter system (GalScreen)._||_Expected Outcome: Compounds significantly suppressing luminescence, and therefore b-galactosidases expression will be identified as hits in the screen.  Compounds that inhibit luminescence activity may kill T. cruzi, inhibit T. cruzi invasion or inhibit development of the parasite within the host cell. Compounds that are toxic to the host cell will be excluded in secondary assays.",
1053133,Assay for stage-specific inhibitors of Vaccinia orthopox Measured in Cell-Based and Microorganism Combination System Using Plate Reader - 2142-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity,"Keywords: Vaccina, orthopoxvirus_||_Assay Overview: Orthopoxviruses are a genus of viruses that include monkeypox, variola (the causative agent of smallpox) and vaccinia, the prototypical orthopoxvirus which was used in the world-wide vaccination program that eradicated smallpox [1]. Smallpox was once the most deadly human pathogen, and is estimated to have killed more than 300 million people. Following the eradication of smallpox, routine vaccination was discontinued in the 1970s, and there has consequently been a precipitous decline in population immunity to smallpox and other orthopoxviruses. There are currently no FDA-licensed drugs to treat infected individuals, which is a significant concern given the threat of orthopoxvirus weaponization and the rise in reports of humans infected with monkeypox, which is endemic to Central and Western Africa [2]. Potent and validated inhibitors of this assay will be of significant interest to public and will provide the development of initial compound leads into therapeutic agents, either as a single agent or as a combination therapy with existing anti-viral agents. _||_In collaboration with the Connor lab, a high throughput assay using vaccinia virus model system was developed. The assay used recombinant viruses (coupled reporter system) that robustly monitor viral gene expression and viral spread to identify novel anti-orthopoxviral compounds. The first infection evaluates the stage gene expression in Vaccinia using the fluorescent Venus protein while the late infection uses the fluorescent mCherry protein reporter._||_Expected Outcome: Compounds that show a statistically significant inhibition of the mCherry late expression fluorescence signal, and that also show a significant window of lower inhibition of the Venus early expression fluorescence signal, will be considered active._||_[1] Moss B (2007) Poxviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication.
